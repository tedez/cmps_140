*Well, thank you very much. I’m honored to be here with many of the great American workers as we take historic action to accelerate the incredible revival of American manufacturing. It truly is a revival. Nobody thought it was possible, actually. And not only is it possible, but we’re thriving. We’re also grateful to be joined by Secretary Acosta, Administrator McMahon, and Representative Robert Aderholt, Mario Diaz-Balart.**

*And we're working on a lot of interesting projects in your neck of the woods, aren’t we, huh? How’s that all going?**

*Mr. President, you are a champion of freedom in this country.**

*I didn’t expect that. I never told him to say that. [Laughter] Well, that was a great move. Every once in a while [Inaudible]. [Laughter] And you too, that I can tell you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Robert Aderholt. Robert, thank you very much. David Joyce, Anthony Gonzalez, and David Rouzer.**

*Thank you all for being here. We really worked hard on this. And I appreciate your support. In the eight years before I took office, we lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. They were leaving. People were talking about the fact that you needed a magic wand; you’ll never bring them back. You remember the previous administration, he said that they said -- he said -- they all said you needed a magic wand; manufacturing jobs were over.**

*I guess you people heard that too. It was a little bit discouraging. And since the election, we’ve gained more than 500,000 jobs -- and that number is going to be very soon to 700,000 jobs -- all in the manufacturing world, which is a beautiful world, a high-paying world, and very important for our country.**

*Last year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing employment in more than 20 years. Early in my presidency, I issued an executive order directing the federal government to live by two very crucial rules: Buy American and hire American. And I think that sounds appropriate. Remember in the old days? It was not that.**

*It was almost the opposite. You’d say, “Where are they coming from?” Thanks to my executive order and a really great group of people, we have increased reliance on American-made goods very, very substantially. Federal agencies are now spending an additional $24 billion on American-made products instead of going to other countries or foreign-made products.**

*Federal spending on foreign goods is now the lowest it’s been in more than 10 years, and it’s going down very substantially. And, by the way, we don’t get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals, and that’s changing rapidly. But we are now looking out a little bit for ourselves and it’s about time.**

*Today, I’m taking action to build on this tremendous success by strengthening the Buy American principle for federal infrastructure and federal spending. We want American roads, bridges, and railways, and everything else to be built with American iron, American steel, American concrete, and American hands.**

*And if you look at what’s happened with the steel industry, it’s actually amazing. The steel industry is thriving now and it was dead when I came to office. It was dead. It was a dead industry. They were dumping steel all over the place. The jobs were going. And if any of you were in the steel industry, I think you can probably tell them, you know.**

*And aluminum, too. But when you look at what’s happened to the steel industry, it’s been incredible. One of the great successes. And now prices are starting to come down because they’re competing with each other. Nucor and U.S. Steel and so many of these companies, they’re building many, many plants all over the United States.**

*And as those plants open, they’re finally competing with themselves. We literally were not going to have steel companies. We weren’t going to make steel in this country. And that in itself is a very important thing. We have to have steel. There are some products you have to have. And, by the way, steel is one of them.**

*You talked about defense -- how do you do it without steel and aluminum and the kinds of things that we're really very heavily focused on. By signing this order today, we renew our commitment to an essential truth: It matters where something is made, and it matters very greatly. When I came to office, and I witnessed for many years -- for decades, frankly -- they didn’t care where it was made.**

*I care where it’s made. It should be made right here in the USA. And we’ve taken a very strong stand. I want to introduce, before I sign, Peter Navarro and Kevin Hassett, two of my great economic people. And they’re going to give you a little talk as to what’s happened and how good we’re doing.**

*Peter, do you want to start?**

*Thank you, Mr. President. I remember back during the campaign, the naysayers said that this President could not restore the manufacturing base. I’m just going to show you a couple pictures here. What we have here is a chart that shows the loss of 192,000 jobs during the eight years of the Obama administration.**

*It did tick up a little bit during Obama’s last two years: 73,000. But it is absolutely dwarfed by the policies of this President: 473,000 since Inauguration Day, and over 500,000 since the election. And then you can see how the emphasis is on this administration in putting men and women who work with their hands to work.**

*You can see the jobs created in the Obama administration: One percent of the total job gains were manufacturing compared to 10 percent. And the folks here that you see on the President’s right come from across this great country, and they build essentially the mother’s milk of Americana. It’s lamppost, it’s fire hydrants, it’s water mains.**

*And we salute these workers today coming in this White House. Kevin is going to show you another chart that shows how these distribution of manufacturing gains are across this country, and then we’ll kick it back to Mr. President.**

*And again, the economics literature, Mr. President, when you were running for office basically said that manufacturing was going the way of agriculture in the previous century; that it was just on an inevitable decline as a percentage of GDP. But it also focused a lot on this idea that there was a rust belt in America.**

*There was a place where there used to be manufacturing, where there was disproportionate harm to workers. And I think the thing that’s really, really interesting about the manufacturing jobs that have been created by our policies -- your policies -- are that they’re scattered throughout America. The dark red part is a place where manufacturing jobs are up by 20 percent or more since you last took office.**

*Wow. That's fantastic.**

*And then the lighter reds are 10 percent or more. And the lightest red is 5 percent or more. But if you look at all the pockets all across the country, including in places that people used to call the Rust Belt, where manufacturing employment is booming, what it means is that there’s basically a boom belt from coast to coast that's been created by our policies.**

*Well, you know, Kevin, when I took over, the Rust Belt was really in trouble. Many people were saying it’s dying, it’s dead; people were leaving. And I love the Rust Belt, and the Rust Belt is no longer the Rust Belt as far as I’m concerned. It’s vibrant. It’s doing so well. You look at all of those red marks, those red marks are where it’s flourishing.**

*Tremendous numbers. And that’s fantastic. We’re very proud. I wish, frankly, that the media would report how well we’re doing in manufacturing, how well we’re doing with the economy. They don’t seem to report how well we’re doing. I think if you had another President, it would be the biggest story, because it really is the biggest story, or certainly one of the biggest stories.**

*And you see the market, how it is. It hit 25,000 yesterday. We’re doing great. We’re doing great as a country. And we have a lot of bite-back because other countries are not doing well. China is having a very hard time. They’re here now. We’re going to be seeing them a little bit later. We’re trying to work out a new trade deal with China.**

*I think it will happen. Something will happen. But it’s a very big deal. It will be -- if it does happen, it will be, by far, the largest trade deal ever made. And we essentially didn’t have a trade deal with China. We lost $500 billion with China, for many years, a year. Anywhere from $300- to $500-, $505 billion a year was lost in our dealing with China.**

*And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and I think we’ll sit down at the end -- at the end of the negotiation by our representatives -- and do something with respect to making a deal with China. I think it has a very good chance of happening. But China is having a very hard time with their economy, and the European Union is having a hard time.**

*A lot of things going on. And we’re getting tremendous numbers. Tremendous unemployment numbers -- among the best we’ve ever had in the history of our country. Individual groups the best: African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women. Numbers that we haven’t seen before. The overall is the best numbers.**

*Best employment numbers in 51 years. So we're doing really well. I wish the press would report it. I'm going to sign this. Before I do, I think I want to just ask a few of you folks, would you like to say something? Anybody? Anybody want to become a congressman by [Inaudible]?**

*Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for the tax cuts. It's been rocket fuel for our business for manufacturing.**

*Thank you very much. That was great. Charlie? That was great.**

*Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for the -- this Buy American push that you've got with federal funding for the infrastructure that's Buy American. It's jobs for us. And it puts us in a position where we can compete. Otherwise, we tend to walk to away from jobs where foreign competition is going to take our business.**

*Yeah. We're changing that fast.**

*Thank you.**

*Big difference. Big difference.**

*And I'm with McWane, in Birmingham. We're based out of Birmingham, Alabama. We have seen a tremendous uptick. We're representing several divisions with McWane here, but thank you for everything you've done.**

*That's great. Great group. Thank you. Thank you all very much. You want to say anything? Anybody else? Anybody want to become a congressperson?**

*Just that it gives us an opportunity to hire, obviously even more opportunities that we have to fill positions as jobs increase.**

*That's Brenda Martinez with U.S. Foundry. She's our HR, and she hires people when we get more work.**

*Big difference. Right?**

*Yes.**

*Thank you all very much. So how about our politicians? Now, they want to say, that I know. [Laughter] These people -- they're not shy.**

*Well, let me say, first of all, that this is a very commonsense, a bipartisan piece of executive order that the President -- we have worked on legislation in the past that's worked this from the appropriations side from year to year. But what this executive order does, it goes beyond that and it really tries to make sure that we -- as the President said, American hands are doing the job and this is what we're -- when we go back home, we want to see our manufacturers do well.**

*We want to see them grow. We want to see our workers do -- have better jobs. So thanks, Mr. President, for doing it. So, thank you.**

*Thank you. Appreciate it.**

*Mr. President, if I may -- this gentleman here has been a long-time leader on the hill carrying the Buy American banner, and his leadership is very much appreciated.**

*That’s why he wins by so much.**

*Yes. That is correct. [Laughter]**

*That's why he doesn’t worry too much about races. You know? Just wins.**

*It helps when you've got a district that he wins about 80 percent. So -- [Laughter].**

*I think I did very well. [Laughter] Come to think of it.**

*The best of 435 districts, so --**

*That’s great. That's very nice. Thank you very much. Say hello. Linda?**

*Well, thank you very much. I hear from small businesses, you know, all over the country, and they are very happy to be buying American and hiring American. And, you know, the job growth, it just speaks for itself. And our businesses are growing and starting and expanding.**

*Great job you're doing too. She runs the Small Business, and they're big business when you add it all up. She's done a fantastic job -- Linda McMahon. Mr. Secretary?**

*Mr. President, you know, in the past, we've encouraged individuals out there to buy American. But what you're doing is so important because you're leading by example. You're saying the federal government will buy American. And we've seen the impact last year with, you know, a 10-year record low in foreign purchases.**

*And this is going to take it to the next step, and it will translate into more jobs for individuals, just like those here today.**

*It's having an incredible effect. I mean, people don’t realize it yet, but they're seeing it more and more. We are mandating even pipelines and things that were made elsewhere. They're starting to be made here because we have a steel industry again. But it's having a tremendous effect. Please.**

*Thank you, Mr. President, I have been co-sponsoring a bill for years with Daniel Lipinski. Couldn’t get it to go anywhere. I'm honored that you're doing it today to force it into action because, as you said, these are American jobs. It's American concrete, it's American steel, it's American asphalt. Thank you for doing so.**

*Thank you very much. I appreciate it.**

*Well, Mr. President, you can't believe how much my folks back home in Eastern North Carolina appreciate your commitment to the American worker, and particularly the American farmer. And I personally really appreciate you taking it to China. They have eaten our lunch for a long, long time, and I appreciate you standing up and really fighting hard for our American workers, and the job creation that’s going to result from that.**

*And keep plugging for America's farmers.**

*So China, as you know, has opened up because of us to the financial services industry, which is a big thing. Nobody thought that was possible. And they've opened up to financial services and things of the like. But I just want to let everyone know we won't have a deal if we don’t open it up to the farmers, and we won't have a deal if they don’t open it up to our manufacturers, and just all of it. And I think China is very prone to do this.**

*So we're going to have a talk. But we've already got financial services. A big impact. You have tremendous amounts of money. Tremendous amounts of people. It's a whole different market, and a massive market. I guess you could certainly say the biggest, or one of the biggest markets in the world, but maybe the biggest market in a certain way in the world.**

*But we're the number-one country in the world economically. I don’t want people to forget that. We're the number one. And we were heading -- we were heading south fast. We were going down, and we turned it around. And it started with the regulations that we cut. We cut more regulations than any administration in the history of our country in two years.**

*And, actually, less than two years. And it also was helped by the tax cuts. Put a lot of people to work and really gave companies something where they're now coming back into our country, they're investing in our country, and they're expanding in our country. So, a lot of great things are happening. Mario?**

*Mr. President, I, again, it's amazing what leadership does. The economy is booming, you're rebuilding our military, you're leading around the world. Enough said.**

*Thank you. I'm liking this guy more and more. [Laughter]**

*Let me just add one thing that I have -- this makes my 22nd year serving in the House of Representatives. This President has stood up more for manufacturing jobs in Alabama and across the country -- not just Alabama -- than any President. So I thank you for standing up.**

*And Robert and Mario have been leaders on the Reciprocal Trade Act, as well, that you're sponsoring.**

*I know. Reciprocal trade is going be very important. We're going putting in a bill very soon, where when a country charges us tariffs that are massive, and we charge them nothing for the same exact product, we just say, "Hey, got to be equal. You charge us, we charge you." You could call it a reciprocal tax, but some people call it a mirror tax.**

*So, if Europe, as an example -- the EU charges us 72 percent tariff on corn, and they don’t even want it, and we charge them nothing -- it doesn’t work that way anymore. So, you know, I've gone to many people that aren’t that familiar with it, including politicians that you'll be dealing with soon.**

*And I went to a couple that are always tough. I said, "What do you think of that? They charge us, we charge them." They looked at me and they said, Robert, "Huh. Sounds fair to me." And, actually, you probably get rid of tariffs, because rather than charging 75 percent to nothing, now if you're both at 75, you say, "Let's call it quits.**

*We'll go to nothing." So it really has that impact too, as you know. Please.**

*Thank you, Mr. President. So, as you know, northeast Ohio is all about jobs and the economy. And Dave and I are from the same neck of the woods. And to see the cranes, buildings going up, to see steel jobs coming back -- to your point, they said it couldn’t be done, and now wages are going up. When was the last time real wages went up? It’s been a while.**

*So keep doing what you're doing, and we support you in northeast Ohio on everything with the economy.**

*Thank you.**

*So, thank you.**

*And they're getting -- it’s a beautiful thing because I opened up, as you know -- the best iron ore, they say, virtually in the world is in Minnesota. The big mines. They were closed. President Obama decided to close them. I opened them. And we're not bringing it in; we’re taking it right from our own home.**

*And we're having it made in Ohio. We have good ore in Ohio, too. But we're having it made in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and all the different places. It's been really incredible to see what's happening. We don’t need anything from outside of our own boundaries. So that’s been really great.**

*Okay, let's go. [Laughter] Does anybody want this pen? Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. [The executive order is signed] Okay, here you go. [Applause] Thank you, everybody, very much. I appreciate it.**

*Mr. President, [Inaudible] your intelligence officials yesterday. Do you still have confidence in Gina Haspel and Dan Coats to give you good advice?**

*No, I disagree with certain things that they said. I think I'm right, but time will prove that. Time will prove me right, probably. I think Iran is a threat. I think it's a very big threat. And I think I did a great thing when I terminated the ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible, one-sided deal that was $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash, and lots of other bad things.**

*If you remember, they took our 10 sailors out of waters that people are disputing, and made us look very bad. But, of course, the payment was due the following day, so they eventually let them go, which they had to. I disagree very much on that. I also think -- and you'll be seeing something next week -- because you look at what's happened in Syria with respect to ISIS and the caliphate.**

*We took over a lot of area in the last two weeks. We've done tremendous in the last couple of weeks. At the same time, we're consolidating, and a tremendous amount of good things are happening. You even look at what's going on -- and I can't tell you that this is a guarantee because we're going into close to 19 years in being in Afghanistan.**

*And, for the first time, they're talking about settling. They're talking about making an agreement. And we bring our people back home if that happens. We'll see what happens, but they're in very serious negotiations for the first time. There's a reason for that. So I think we're doing so well on a foreign policy basis.**

*If you look at North Korea -- and many of you are going to be traveling with us to North Korea and -- for the meetings with North Korea. We're going to a certain location. I think most of you know where the location is. I don't think it's any great secret. But we'll be announcing the location and the date -- the exact date.**

*It will be at the end of February. And we've made tremendous progress with North Korea. When I came in -- or, let's say, at the end of the last administration -- frankly, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now there's no missile testing. There's no rocket testing. There's no nuclear testing.**

*We got back our prisoners or our hostages. And we're getting back our remains; they're coming in. And we've had some beautiful ceremonies in Hawaii, other places. So I just tell you that we are doing really well. Our military is being rebuilt. It's very close to being rebuilt. We have tremendous amounts of new aircraft, new ships, new weapons of all kinds, which we need -- because, hopefully, the stronger we get, the less you have to use it. I guess you know that from growing up in school.**

*The stronger we are, the less we're going to have you use it, and we don't want to have to use it. But we're going to have the strongest military, by far, that we've ever had. So I didn't see the report from the intelligence. When you read it, it's a lot different than it was covered on in the news. But I think that Iran is somebody -- is a nation that we have to watch very closely.**

*They sent up a rocket the other day, and it failed. But it was sent up. Now, they can say they're sending it up for civilian purposes, but I don't think too many people believe that. They're doing tests. And we don't want to be in a position where we're behind. We're not going to be leading from behind anymore.**

*So that's the story. I have great respect for a lot of people, but I don't always agree with everybody. Okay?**

*What concessions has China made so far in the talks? Anything on IP theft?**

*So, it's great. Well, we're going to -- look, we're going to go into everything. You probably saw, this morning I put out a statement. We're going into everything. This isn't going to be a small deal with China. This is either going to be a very big deal or it's going to be a deal that we'll just postpone for a little while.**

*But we've been dealing with China. We've had a great relationship. I have a great relationship with President Xi. The relationship of my people to Chinese representatives has been very good. They're negotiating now. They'll be coming over here at about 4 o'clock, and we'll be talking to, actually, one of the top leaders in China, as you know.**

*I think that probably the final deal will be made. If it's made, will be made between myself and President Xi. But we're certainly talking about theft. We're talking about every aspect of trade with a country. And we're talking about fentanyl, too. As you know, most of the fentanyl -- which is killing 80,000 Americans a year is -- it comes through China.**

*And, in China, it was not criminalized. And they've agreed to criminalize fentanyl and give it the maximum penalty. The maximum penalty in China, if you're selling drugs, is death; it's the death penalty. And they've agreed to do the death penalty for selling fentanyl. And if it's shipped to the United States, that would be a very severe penalty.**

*So I think that's going to have a tremendous impact. We put that one item into the trade deal -- the fentanyl. I think that's a very important item to put in. But they've agreed -- they've agree, and agreed very readily -- we really appreciate it -- to criminalize the sale of fentanyl. Steve?**

*Do you think you'll make the March 1 deadline?**

*I don't know. I mean, it's --**

*And you are going to add [Inaudible]?**

*I can tell you, there's -- a lot of people are working. What happens -- we're charging large tariffs to Chinese products that are coming in, which hurts China. As you know -- you saw the reports -- out of the 25 points, we're paying for four points out of the 25. They're paying for 21. That's a big difference.**

*I've always said that. We're taking in billions of dollars. And, frankly, we're creating a lot of industry. But the rate goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on March 1st. So they would like to do it, and I'd like to accommodate them. If we can, I'd like to accommodate China if we can get the deal done. It's a lot of work because this is a very comprehensive deal.**

*This isn't what we're talking about, you know, they're going to buy some corn and that's going to be it. No, they're going to buy corn. Hopefully, they're going to buy lots of corn, and lots of wheat, and lots of everything else that we have. But they're also talking heavy technology, heavy manufacturing, financial services, and everything else.**

*So you may have to extend the talks beyond March the 1st? Is that what you're saying, sir?**

*I think we can do it by March 1st. Can you get it down on paper by March 1st? I don't know. I can say, on March 1st, the tariff on China goes to 25 percent, and that's a big tariff.**

*I'm just curious, what's the tone looking like for the State of the Union, sir? And then, I don't know if you've seen, the Democrats have tapped the rebuttal speech -- Stacey Abrams, who ran for Governor of Georgia. Any thoughts on their pick, sir, or any of the messaging?**

*Oh, I campaigned against Stacey Abrams. I know that President Obama campaigned for her. Michelle Obama campaigned for her. And Oprah campaigned for her. And all Brian had was me. And he won fairly easily -- you know, fairly easy. So I hope that she does a good job. I mean, I respect her. I don't know her.**

*I haven't met her. But I hope she does a good job.**

*And the tone for your speech, sir -- can you tell us --**

*I think it's unification. I think it's industry. I think it's about the people that you see right here. It's also working with these people, because they've been incredible. We have had some incredible report. And we've have incredible Republican support. The problem is, the Democrats -- you know, when they say, "We don't want to build…" -- as an example, "We don't want to build a wall because it doesn't work or because it's immoral." Well, it's also immoral the people that come into our country that shouldn't be here and kill people.**

*That's immoral, too. That's a lot more immoral. So -- but I really think it's doing to be a speech that's going to cover a lot of territory. But part of it is going to be unity. Yeah, please.**

*Mr. President, Nancy Pelosi said this morning that there is not going to be a wall in this deal, but she did say she'd be open to other kinds of physical barriers. Would you accept that?**

*No, because if there's no wall, it doesn't work. She's just playing games. So if there's no wall, it doesn't work. And we're building the wall right now. I mean, a lot of people don't know that, but we have a lot of wall under construction. We've given out a lot of contracts over the last three, four weeks -- good contracts.**

*A lot of wall is soon going to be under construction. We will be -- we're finishing up design on certain areas, the most important areas -- the Rio Grande area and others. We are building a lot of wall. You know, I’m not waiting for this committee. And I've told a lot of people I don't expect much coming out of the committee because I keep hearing the words that, "We'll give you what you want, but we're not going to give you wall." The problem is, if they don't give us a wall, it doesn't work.**

*Without a wall, it doesn't work. We have caravans right now coming up from Honduras, who we give a lot of money to -- which is stopping, by the way. But we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And then they have caravans leaving their country, coming up here. And, by the way, if you go to Tijuana and you take down that wall, you will have so many people coming into our country that Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall.**

*She'll be begging for a wall. She will say, "Mr. President, please, please give us a wall." It'd be very interesting. Some people have suggested: Let me take the wall along California, let's move it to Arizona, let's move it to Texas. And, you know, it's going to -- it would be a very interesting statement.**

*About Nancy: So, in California, they wanted the wall built in San Diego so badly. And we built it. And probably I should have waited, because as soon as it was finished, they started screaming, "We don't want a wall. We don't want a wall." But they wanted the wall so badly. And, by the way, it worked. Nobody is getting through.**

*But the minute it was built, they started saying, "We don't want a wall." Without a wall, it doesn't work. It's very simple. I mean, I'm not saying this as a Republican. I'm not saying it as anything other than a fact-stater. Without a wall, it just doesn't work.**

*Mr. President, after listening to the hardship from many federal government workers, as well as those who were contractors and who relied on the federal government employees' finances to fund their businesses, are you willing to jeopardize the economy again, and also your presidency, with people who are fearful of another government shutdown over this wall?**

*And also, I want to ask you about Jussie Smollett. Have you heard about that story? In Chicago, a situation -- the actor from "Empire" who was allegedly attacked with racist and homophobic --**

*That, I can tell you, is horrible. I've seen it last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I'm concerned. As far as the people are concerned, many of those people wanted me to stay out, but I didn’t want to do it because people were getting hurt. People -- what I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we're allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic, and do all of these horrible things.**

*That if we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country. That, to me, is the great sin. And everybody knows it works. I watched this morning, early in the morning, somebody trying to justify walls are immoral. I mean, if walls are immoral, maybe we should take down all the walls that are built right now.**

*You will see a mess like you've never seen before. So I only say this: I was elected partially on this issue -- not as much as people say, but partially on this issue. This is a very important issue. Nothing to do with elections. Nothing to do with votes. Nothing. Only to do with common sense and only to do with security.**

*And if we don’t put up a barrier or wall -- a strong one, but one that looks good -- in the old days, they used to build them; they looked terrible. Now we build them, they look really good. If we don’t put up a physical barrier, you can forget it. Our country is going to be a very unsafe place. People are coming in. Drugs are coming in. Human trafficking is coming in, which is so horrible.**

*Things are happening that won't happen after the wall is constructed. So we're building a lot of wall. We're building new sections that are starting in about two weeks. We're building some brand new sections -- large sections. And the wall is getting built. I would like to build it even faster, but it's getting built, and it's getting built very substantially, as some of you see because you've been there.**

*Yeah, please.**

*I have an immigration question. But first, if I could just clarify something you said about North Korea. Do you have an agreement with North Korea on the time and place for that next summit?**

*Yes. I do.**

*Can you share it?**

*Yeah, we're going to very soon. We're going to announce it pretty soon. We'll be announcing it early next week.**

*Okay. And you also said that --**

*And they very much want the meeting, and I think they really want to do something. We'll see. But I think they really want. But again, remember, North Korea was a whole different story. When I came to office, many people thought we were going to war with North Korea. I would sit and listen, and I would read people saying, "Go to war with North Korea." Well, you'd lose, I mean potentially, hundreds of millions of lives.**

*You know, Seoul has 30-some-odd million people, and it's literally right off their wall, by the way. But that wall works, I can tell you.**

*About the wall, you just said that people make that out to be a bigger deal on your election than you --**

*Well, it was one of my points. I had -- yeah.**

*I mean, you would consider that the biggest campaign --**

*Now they say it's the wall, because I've accomplished practically everything else. Look, I accomplished the military. I accomplished the tax cuts. I accomplished the regulation cuts. I accomplished so much. The economy is the number-one economy in the world. We're the number-one economy in the world. We're the number one, not even close.**

*Companies are pouring into our country. I've accomplished so much. So now they say, "Oh, if he doesn’t get the wall…" -- they make that the only issue. But it's not going to work, because I'm building the wall. The wall is happening right now, okay?**

*The government has been reopened for several days now. Are you closer or farther apart on an immigration deal, now that -- since you opened the government?**

*With respect to the committee?**

*Yes.**

*I would say we're the same. Because I'm hearing they don’t want to do a wall, for political reasons. I actually think it's bad politics. I mean, frankly, I think them fighting us on what everybody knows has to be done to have proper security. And you can add the other things, but the other things only really work if you have the physical barrier.**

*Without the physical barrier, you just won't -- what are you going to have? Drones flying over the 12,000 people? You're going to have a nice drone flying -- doing circles around the 12,000 people that are walking in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador? No, you don’t want that. So I want to do real things, like the deal with China.**

*I want it to be a real deal. I could do a deal with China, where people would say, "Isn't that wonderful?" It's not wonderful. I have to do the real deal. We have to open up China. We're open to them. They have to be open to us. So, it would be so easy for me to make a deal with China, but it wouldn’t be a real deal.**

*I could get them to buy more corn than they've ever bought, and more soybeans than they've ever bought. And they'd be so happy if I did that. But they're going to do that, but in even higher numbers. But we're going to do a lot of other things. And just remember, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China.**

*We never took in 10 cents from China. China is being charged tremendous amounts of money for the privilege of coming in and doing what they do to our country. They're being charged a tremendous amount of money. And we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal with China, but it's going to be a very comprehensive deal.**

*We're going to cover everything, okay?**

*You mentioned all the economic indicators are going up. Why then is the -- are U.S. deficits and the financial debt increasing at a time when the economy is --**

*Well, the trade deals won't kick in for a while. You know, number one, the USMCA hasn’t even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. During the campaign, I said I will either terminate NAFTA or negotiate a new deal.**

*And we negotiated a good deal. Now, if you went back to pre-NAFTA, that would be, frankly, okay with me. Pre-NAFTA or the new deal. But I won't allow NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal for this country. If you look at the scars all over our country, where you go to New England, you go to Ohio, you go to Pennsylvania, you see what -- I mean, what happened in North Carolina -- you have factories that are still empty from what happened with NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal.**

*The USMCA is a great deal. But pre-NAFTA was -- we had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.**

*One more on the wall. You said the wall is being basically held hostage for political reasons by the Democrats. Is there anything you would have done differently in the first two years to get this --**

*No, there's nothing -- look, they had this from day one.**

*-- [Inaudible] wall finished --**

*Could I have done it differently? No, not really. I mean, I think what -- by having the shutdown, we've set the table for where we are now. If I didn’t do the shutdown, people wouldn’t know -- they wouldn’t understand the subject. Now they understand the subject. They realize what a humanitarian crisis it is. It's sort of -- it's called, like in deal-making, "setting the table," or, you know, setting the stage.**

*We've set the stage for what's going to happen on the 15th of February. I don’t think they're going to make a deal. I see what's happening. They're all saying, "Oh, let's do this, but we're not giving one dime for the wall." That's okay. But if they're not going to give money for the wall, it's not going to work.**

*And if it's not going to work, then the politicians are really wasting a lot of time. Okay.**

*Mr. President, will you declare a national emergency if there's no money for the wall?**

*I would do that. I would do that.**

*So why hasn’t --**

*We have money. Just so you understand: We have money. We're building the wall right now -- a lot of it. People don’t know that, and nobody reports it, but that's okay. Because it's not very exciting when you say it's built. You know, people. But let me just tell you: We're building the wall right now. It's going up fairly rapidly.**

*We're renovating tremendous amounts of wall, which is good stuff that's in very bad shape with massive holes in it and fencing coming down. It's being beautifully renovated. In some cases, we have to replace it. We renovate some. We replace some. We build some new. But the wall is going up right now in all different forms.**

*Thank you very much, everybody.**

*What's been holding you back from declaring a national emergency?**

*We're going to see what happens on February 15th.**

*Are you concerned about legal challenges?**

*Against who?**

*Are you concerned about legal challenges?**

*No, I'm not concerned. I'm not concerned.**

*But you still don’t think there's going to be a deal, but you're not going to declare it now. Don’t you think that --**

*I'm waiting -- excuse me. I didn’t say that. I said I'm waiting until February 15th. On February 15th, the committee will come back, and if they don’t have a wall, I don’t even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time. Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall.**

*Now, when you couple the wall with sensors and drones and all of these other things, that works, as a combination. But if you don’t have a wall, they're all just wasting their time. It's just politics. Thank you all very much.**

*Well, thank you very much. I’m honored to be here with many of the great American workers as we take historic action to accelerate the incredible revival of American manufacturing. It truly is a revival. Nobody thought it was possible, actually. And not only is it possible, but we’re thriving. We’re also grateful to be joined by Secretary Acosta, Administrator McMahon, and Representative Robert Aderholt, Mario Diaz-Balart.**

*And we're working on a lot of interesting projects in your neck of the woods, aren’t we, huh? How’s that all going?**

*Mr. President, you are a champion of freedom in this country.**

*I didn’t expect that. I never told him to say that. [Laughter] Well, that was a great move. Every once in a while [Inaudible]. [Laughter] And you too, that I can tell you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Robert Aderholt. Robert, thank you very much. David Joyce, Anthony Gonzalez, and David Rouzer.**

*Thank you all for being here. We really worked hard on this. And I appreciate your support. In the eight years before I took office, we lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. They were leaving. People were talking about the fact that you needed a magic wand; you’ll never bring them back. You remember the previous administration, he said that they said -- he said -- they all said you needed a magic wand; manufacturing jobs were over.**

*I guess you people heard that too. It was a little bit discouraging. And since the election, we’ve gained more than 500,000 jobs -- and that number is going to be very soon to 700,000 jobs -- all in the manufacturing world, which is a beautiful world, a high-paying world, and very important for our country.**

*Last year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing employment in more than 20 years. Early in my presidency, I issued an executive order directing the federal government to live by two very crucial rules: Buy American and hire American. And I think that sounds appropriate. Remember in the old days? It was not that.**

*It was almost the opposite. You’d say, “Where are they coming from?” Thanks to my executive order and a really great group of people, we have increased reliance on American-made goods very, very substantially. Federal agencies are now spending an additional $24 billion on American-made products instead of going to other countries or foreign-made products.**

*Federal spending on foreign goods is now the lowest it’s been in more than 10 years, and it’s going down very substantially. And, by the way, we don’t get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals, and that’s changing rapidly. But we are now looking out a little bit for ourselves and it’s about time.**

*Today, I’m taking action to build on this tremendous success by strengthening the Buy American principle for federal infrastructure and federal spending. We want American roads, bridges, and railways, and everything else to be built with American iron, American steel, American concrete, and American hands.**

*And if you look at what’s happened with the steel industry, it’s actually amazing. The steel industry is thriving now and it was dead when I came to office. It was dead. It was a dead industry. They were dumping steel all over the place. The jobs were going. And if any of you were in the steel industry, I think you can probably tell them, you know.**

*And aluminum, too. But when you look at what’s happened to the steel industry, it’s been incredible. One of the great successes. And now prices are starting to come down because they’re competing with each other. Nucor and U.S. Steel and so many of these companies, they’re building many, many plants all over the United States.**

*And as those plants open, they’re finally competing with themselves. We literally were not going to have steel companies. We weren’t going to make steel in this country. And that in itself is a very important thing. We have to have steel. There are some products you have to have. And, by the way, steel is one of them.**

*You talked about defense -- how do you do it without steel and aluminum and the kinds of things that we're really very heavily focused on. By signing this order today, we renew our commitment to an essential truth: It matters where something is made, and it matters very greatly. When I came to office, and I witnessed for many years -- for decades, frankly -- they didn’t care where it was made.**

*I care where it’s made. It should be made right here in the USA. And we’ve taken a very strong stand. I want to introduce, before I sign, Peter Navarro and Kevin Hassett, two of my great economic people. And they’re going to give you a little talk as to what’s happened and how good we’re doing.**

*Peter, do you want to start?**

*Thank you, Mr. President. I remember back during the campaign, the naysayers said that this President could not restore the manufacturing base. I’m just going to show you a couple pictures here. What we have here is a chart that shows the loss of 192,000 jobs during the eight years of the Obama administration.**

*It did tick up a little bit during Obama’s last two years: 73,000. But it is absolutely dwarfed by the policies of this President: 473,000 since Inauguration Day, and over 500,000 since the election. And then you can see how the emphasis is on this administration in putting men and women who work with their hands to work.**

*You can see the jobs created in the Obama administration: One percent of the total job gains were manufacturing compared to 10 percent. And the folks here that you see on the President’s right come from across this great country, and they build essentially the mother’s milk of Americana. It’s lamppost, it’s fire hydrants, it’s water mains.**

*And we salute these workers today coming in this White House. Kevin is going to show you another chart that shows how these distribution of manufacturing gains are across this country, and then we’ll kick it back to Mr. President.**

*And again, the economics literature, Mr. President, when you were running for office basically said that manufacturing was going the way of agriculture in the previous century; that it was just on an inevitable decline as a percentage of GDP. But it also focused a lot on this idea that there was a rust belt in America.**

*There was a place where there used to be manufacturing, where there was disproportionate harm to workers. And I think the thing that’s really, really interesting about the manufacturing jobs that have been created by our policies -- your policies -- are that they’re scattered throughout America. The dark red part is a place where manufacturing jobs are up by 20 percent or more since you last took office.**

*Wow. That's fantastic.**

*And then the lighter reds are 10 percent or more. And the lightest red is 5 percent or more. But if you look at all the pockets all across the country, including in places that people used to call the Rust Belt, where manufacturing employment is booming, what it means is that there’s basically a boom belt from coast to coast that's been created by our policies.**

*Well, you know, Kevin, when I took over, the Rust Belt was really in trouble. Many people were saying it’s dying, it’s dead; people were leaving. And I love the Rust Belt, and the Rust Belt is no longer the Rust Belt as far as I’m concerned. It’s vibrant. It’s doing so well. You look at all of those red marks, those red marks are where it’s flourishing.**

*Tremendous numbers. And that’s fantastic. We’re very proud. I wish, frankly, that the media would report how well we’re doing in manufacturing, how well we’re doing with the economy. They don’t seem to report how well we’re doing. I think if you had another President, it would be the biggest story, because it really is the biggest story, or certainly one of the biggest stories.**

*And you see the market, how it is. It hit 25,000 yesterday. We’re doing great. We’re doing great as a country. And we have a lot of bite-back because other countries are not doing well. China is having a very hard time. They’re here now. We’re going to be seeing them a little bit later. We’re trying to work out a new trade deal with China.**

*I think it will happen. Something will happen. But it’s a very big deal. It will be -- if it does happen, it will be, by far, the largest trade deal ever made. And we essentially didn’t have a trade deal with China. We lost $500 billion with China, for many years, a year. Anywhere from $300- to $500-, $505 billion a year was lost in our dealing with China.**

*And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and I think we’ll sit down at the end -- at the end of the negotiation by our representatives -- and do something with respect to making a deal with China. I think it has a very good chance of happening. But China is having a very hard time with their economy, and the European Union is having a hard time.**

*A lot of things going on. And we’re getting tremendous numbers. Tremendous unemployment numbers -- among the best we’ve ever had in the history of our country. Individual groups the best: African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women. Numbers that we haven’t seen before. The overall is the best numbers.**

*Best employment numbers in 51 years. So we're doing really well. I wish the press would report it. I'm going to sign this. Before I do, I think I want to just ask a few of you folks, would you like to say something? Anybody? Anybody want to become a congressman by [Inaudible]?**

*Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for the tax cuts. It's been rocket fuel for our business for manufacturing.**

*Thank you very much. That was great. Charlie? That was great.**

*Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for the -- this Buy American push that you've got with federal funding for the infrastructure that's Buy American. It's jobs for us. And it puts us in a position where we can compete. Otherwise, we tend to walk to away from jobs where foreign competition is going to take our business.**

*Yeah. We're changing that fast.**

*Thank you.**

*Big difference. Big difference.**

*And I'm with McWane, in Birmingham. We're based out of Birmingham, Alabama. We have seen a tremendous uptick. We're representing several divisions with McWane here, but thank you for everything you've done.**

*That's great. Great group. Thank you. Thank you all very much. You want to say anything? Anybody else? Anybody want to become a congressperson?**

*Just that it gives us an opportunity to hire, obviously even more opportunities that we have to fill positions as jobs increase.**

*That's Brenda Martinez with U.S. Foundry. She's our HR, and she hires people when we get more work.**

*Big difference. Right?**

*Yes.**

*Thank you all very much. So how about our politicians? Now, they want to say, that I know. [Laughter] These people -- they're not shy.**

*Well, let me say, first of all, that this is a very commonsense, a bipartisan piece of executive order that the President -- we have worked on legislation in the past that's worked this from the appropriations side from year to year. But what this executive order does, it goes beyond that and it really tries to make sure that we -- as the President said, American hands are doing the job and this is what we're -- when we go back home, we want to see our manufacturers do well.**

*We want to see them grow. We want to see our workers do -- have better jobs. So thanks, Mr. President, for doing it. So, thank you.**

*Thank you. Appreciate it.**

*Mr. President, if I may -- this gentleman here has been a long-time leader on the hill carrying the Buy American banner, and his leadership is very much appreciated.**

*That’s why he wins by so much.**

*Yes. That is correct. [Laughter]**

*That's why he doesn’t worry too much about races. You know? Just wins.**

*It helps when you've got a district that he wins about 80 percent. So -- [Laughter].**

*I think I did very well. [Laughter] Come to think of it.**

*The best of 435 districts, so --**

*That’s great. That's very nice. Thank you very much. Say hello. Linda?**

*Well, thank you very much. I hear from small businesses, you know, all over the country, and they are very happy to be buying American and hiring American. And, you know, the job growth, it just speaks for itself. And our businesses are growing and starting and expanding.**

*Great job you're doing too. She runs the Small Business, and they're big business when you add it all up. She's done a fantastic job -- Linda McMahon. Mr. Secretary?**

*Mr. President, you know, in the past, we've encouraged individuals out there to buy American. But what you're doing is so important because you're leading by example. You're saying the federal government will buy American. And we've seen the impact last year with, you know, a 10-year record low in foreign purchases.**

*And this is going to take it to the next step, and it will translate into more jobs for individuals, just like those here today.**

*It's having an incredible effect. I mean, people don’t realize it yet, but they're seeing it more and more. We are mandating even pipelines and things that were made elsewhere. They're starting to be made here because we have a steel industry again. But it's having a tremendous effect. Please.**

*Thank you, Mr. President, I have been co-sponsoring a bill for years with Daniel Lipinski. Couldn’t get it to go anywhere. I'm honored that you're doing it today to force it into action because, as you said, these are American jobs. It's American concrete, it's American steel, it's American asphalt. Thank you for doing so.**

*Thank you very much. I appreciate it.**

*Well, Mr. President, you can't believe how much my folks back home in Eastern North Carolina appreciate your commitment to the American worker, and particularly the American farmer. And I personally really appreciate you taking it to China. They have eaten our lunch for a long, long time, and I appreciate you standing up and really fighting hard for our American workers, and the job creation that’s going to result from that.**

*And keep plugging for America's farmers.**

*So China, as you know, has opened up because of us to the financial services industry, which is a big thing. Nobody thought that was possible. And they've opened up to financial services and things of the like. But I just want to let everyone know we won't have a deal if we don’t open it up to the farmers, and we won't have a deal if they don’t open it up to our manufacturers, and just all of it. And I think China is very prone to do this.**

*So we're going to have a talk. But we've already got financial services. A big impact. You have tremendous amounts of money. Tremendous amounts of people. It's a whole different market, and a massive market. I guess you could certainly say the biggest, or one of the biggest markets in the world, but maybe the biggest market in a certain way in the world.**

*But we're the number-one country in the world economically. I don’t want people to forget that. We're the number one. And we were heading -- we were heading south fast. We were going down, and we turned it around. And it started with the regulations that we cut. We cut more regulations than any administration in the history of our country in two years.**

*And, actually, less than two years. And it also was helped by the tax cuts. Put a lot of people to work and really gave companies something where they're now coming back into our country, they're investing in our country, and they're expanding in our country. So, a lot of great things are happening. Mario?**

*Mr. President, I, again, it's amazing what leadership does. The economy is booming, you're rebuilding our military, you're leading around the world. Enough said.**

*Thank you. I'm liking this guy more and more. [Laughter]**

*Let me just add one thing that I have -- this makes my 22nd year serving in the House of Representatives. This President has stood up more for manufacturing jobs in Alabama and across the country -- not just Alabama -- than any President. So I thank you for standing up.**

*And Robert and Mario have been leaders on the Reciprocal Trade Act, as well, that you're sponsoring.**

*I know. Reciprocal trade is going be very important. We're going putting in a bill very soon, where when a country charges us tariffs that are massive, and we charge them nothing for the same exact product, we just say, "Hey, got to be equal. You charge us, we charge you." You could call it a reciprocal tax, but some people call it a mirror tax.**

*So, if Europe, as an example -- the EU charges us 72 percent tariff on corn, and they don’t even want it, and we charge them nothing -- it doesn’t work that way anymore. So, you know, I've gone to many people that aren’t that familiar with it, including politicians that you'll be dealing with soon.**

*And I went to a couple that are always tough. I said, "What do you think of that? They charge us, we charge them." They looked at me and they said, Robert, "Huh. Sounds fair to me." And, actually, you probably get rid of tariffs, because rather than charging 75 percent to nothing, now if you're both at 75, you say, "Let's call it quits.**

*We'll go to nothing." So it really has that impact too, as you know. Please.**

*Thank you, Mr. President. So, as you know, northeast Ohio is all about jobs and the economy. And Dave and I are from the same neck of the woods. And to see the cranes, buildings going up, to see steel jobs coming back -- to your point, they said it couldn’t be done, and now wages are going up. When was the last time real wages went up? It’s been a while.**

*So keep doing what you're doing, and we support you in northeast Ohio on everything with the economy.**

*Thank you.**

*So, thank you.**

*And they're getting -- it’s a beautiful thing because I opened up, as you know -- the best iron ore, they say, virtually in the world is in Minnesota. The big mines. They were closed. President Obama decided to close them. I opened them. And we're not bringing it in; we’re taking it right from our own home.**

*And we're having it made in Ohio. We have good ore in Ohio, too. But we're having it made in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and all the different places. It's been really incredible to see what's happening. We don’t need anything from outside of our own boundaries. So that’s been really great.**

*Okay, let's go. [Laughter] Does anybody want this pen? Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. [The executive order is signed] Okay, here you go. [Applause] Thank you, everybody, very much. I appreciate it.**

*Mr. President, [Inaudible] your intelligence officials yesterday. Do you still have confidence in Gina Haspel and Dan Coats to give you good advice?**

*No, I disagree with certain things that they said. I think I'm right, but time will prove that. Time will prove me right, probably. I think Iran is a threat. I think it's a very big threat. And I think I did a great thing when I terminated the ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible, one-sided deal that was $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash, and lots of other bad things.**

*If you remember, they took our 10 sailors out of waters that people are disputing, and made us look very bad. But, of course, the payment was due the following day, so they eventually let them go, which they had to. I disagree very much on that. I also think -- and you'll be seeing something next week -- because you look at what's happened in Syria with respect to ISIS and the caliphate.**

*We took over a lot of area in the last two weeks. We've done tremendous in the last couple of weeks. At the same time, we're consolidating, and a tremendous amount of good things are happening. You even look at what's going on -- and I can't tell you that this is a guarantee because we're going into close to 19 years in being in Afghanistan.**

*And, for the first time, they're talking about settling. They're talking about making an agreement. And we bring our people back home if that happens. We'll see what happens, but they're in very serious negotiations for the first time. There's a reason for that. So I think we're doing so well on a foreign policy basis.**

*If you look at North Korea -- and many of you are going to be traveling with us to North Korea and -- for the meetings with North Korea. We're going to a certain location. I think most of you know where the location is. I don't think it's any great secret. But we'll be announcing the location and the date -- the exact date.**

*It will be at the end of February. And we've made tremendous progress with North Korea. When I came in -- or, let's say, at the end of the last administration -- frankly, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now there's no missile testing. There's no rocket testing. There's no nuclear testing.**

*We got back our prisoners or our hostages. And we're getting back our remains; they're coming in. And we've had some beautiful ceremonies in Hawaii, other places. So I just tell you that we are doing really well. Our military is being rebuilt. It's very close to being rebuilt. We have tremendous amounts of new aircraft, new ships, new weapons of all kinds, which we need -- because, hopefully, the stronger we get, the less you have to use it. I guess you know that from growing up in school.**

*The stronger we are, the less we're going to have you use it, and we don't want to have to use it. But we're going to have the strongest military, by far, that we've ever had. So I didn't see the report from the intelligence. When you read it, it's a lot different than it was covered on in the news. But I think that Iran is somebody -- is a nation that we have to watch very closely.**

*They sent up a rocket the other day, and it failed. But it was sent up. Now, they can say they're sending it up for civilian purposes, but I don't think too many people believe that. They're doing tests. And we don't want to be in a position where we're behind. We're not going to be leading from behind anymore.**

*So that's the story. I have great respect for a lot of people, but I don't always agree with everybody. Okay?**

*What concessions has China made so far in the talks? Anything on IP theft?**

*So, it's great. Well, we're going to -- look, we're going to go into everything. You probably saw, this morning I put out a statement. We're going into everything. This isn't going to be a small deal with China. This is either going to be a very big deal or it's going to be a deal that we'll just postpone for a little while.**

*But we've been dealing with China. We've had a great relationship. I have a great relationship with President Xi. The relationship of my people to Chinese representatives has been very good. They're negotiating now. They'll be coming over here at about 4 o'clock, and we'll be talking to, actually, one of the top leaders in China, as you know.**

*I think that probably the final deal will be made. If it's made, will be made between myself and President Xi. But we're certainly talking about theft. We're talking about every aspect of trade with a country. And we're talking about fentanyl, too. As you know, most of the fentanyl -- which is killing 80,000 Americans a year is -- it comes through China.**

*And, in China, it was not criminalized. And they've agreed to criminalize fentanyl and give it the maximum penalty. The maximum penalty in China, if you're selling drugs, is death; it's the death penalty. And they've agreed to do the death penalty for selling fentanyl. And if it's shipped to the United States, that would be a very severe penalty.**

*So I think that's going to have a tremendous impact. We put that one item into the trade deal -- the fentanyl. I think that's a very important item to put in. But they've agreed -- they've agree, and agreed very readily -- we really appreciate it -- to criminalize the sale of fentanyl. Steve?**

*Do you think you'll make the March 1 deadline?**

*I don't know. I mean, it's --**

*And you are going to add [Inaudible]?**

*I can tell you, there's -- a lot of people are working. What happens -- we're charging large tariffs to Chinese products that are coming in, which hurts China. As you know -- you saw the reports -- out of the 25 points, we're paying for four points out of the 25. They're paying for 21. That's a big difference.**

*I've always said that. We're taking in billions of dollars. And, frankly, we're creating a lot of industry. But the rate goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on March 1st. So they would like to do it, and I'd like to accommodate them. If we can, I'd like to accommodate China if we can get the deal done. It's a lot of work because this is a very comprehensive deal.**

*This isn't what we're talking about, you know, they're going to buy some corn and that's going to be it. No, they're going to buy corn. Hopefully, they're going to buy lots of corn, and lots of wheat, and lots of everything else that we have. But they're also talking heavy technology, heavy manufacturing, financial services, and everything else.**

*So you may have to extend the talks beyond March the 1st? Is that what you're saying, sir?**

*I think we can do it by March 1st. Can you get it down on paper by March 1st? I don't know. I can say, on March 1st, the tariff on China goes to 25 percent, and that's a big tariff.**

*I'm just curious, what's the tone looking like for the State of the Union, sir? And then, I don't know if you've seen, the Democrats have tapped the rebuttal speech -- Stacey Abrams, who ran for Governor of Georgia. Any thoughts on their pick, sir, or any of the messaging?**

*Oh, I campaigned against Stacey Abrams. I know that President Obama campaigned for her. Michelle Obama campaigned for her. And Oprah campaigned for her. And all Brian had was me. And he won fairly easily -- you know, fairly easy. So I hope that she does a good job. I mean, I respect her. I don't know her.**

*I haven't met her. But I hope she does a good job.**

*And the tone for your speech, sir -- can you tell us --**

*I think it's unification. I think it's industry. I think it's about the people that you see right here. It's also working with these people, because they've been incredible. We have had some incredible report. And we've have incredible Republican support. The problem is, the Democrats -- you know, when they say, "We don't want to build…" -- as an example, "We don't want to build a wall because it doesn't work or because it's immoral." Well, it's also immoral the people that come into our country that shouldn't be here and kill people.**

*That's immoral, too. That's a lot more immoral. So -- but I really think it's doing to be a speech that's going to cover a lot of territory. But part of it is going to be unity. Yeah, please.**

*Mr. President, Nancy Pelosi said this morning that there is not going to be a wall in this deal, but she did say she'd be open to other kinds of physical barriers. Would you accept that?**

*No, because if there's no wall, it doesn't work. She's just playing games. So if there's no wall, it doesn't work. And we're building the wall right now. I mean, a lot of people don't know that, but we have a lot of wall under construction. We've given out a lot of contracts over the last three, four weeks -- good contracts.**

*A lot of wall is soon going to be under construction. We will be -- we're finishing up design on certain areas, the most important areas -- the Rio Grande area and others. We are building a lot of wall. You know, I’m not waiting for this committee. And I've told a lot of people I don't expect much coming out of the committee because I keep hearing the words that, "We'll give you what you want, but we're not going to give you wall." The problem is, if they don't give us a wall, it doesn't work.**

*Without a wall, it doesn't work. We have caravans right now coming up from Honduras, who we give a lot of money to -- which is stopping, by the way. But we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And then they have caravans leaving their country, coming up here. And, by the way, if you go to Tijuana and you take down that wall, you will have so many people coming into our country that Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall.**

*She'll be begging for a wall. She will say, "Mr. President, please, please give us a wall." It'd be very interesting. Some people have suggested: Let me take the wall along California, let's move it to Arizona, let's move it to Texas. And, you know, it's going to -- it would be a very interesting statement.**

*About Nancy: So, in California, they wanted the wall built in San Diego so badly. And we built it. And probably I should have waited, because as soon as it was finished, they started screaming, "We don't want a wall. We don't want a wall." But they wanted the wall so badly. And, by the way, it worked. Nobody is getting through.**

*But the minute it was built, they started saying, "We don't want a wall." Without a wall, it doesn't work. It's very simple. I mean, I'm not saying this as a Republican. I'm not saying it as anything other than a fact-stater. Without a wall, it just doesn't work.**

*Mr. President, after listening to the hardship from many federal government workers, as well as those who were contractors and who relied on the federal government employees' finances to fund their businesses, are you willing to jeopardize the economy again, and also your presidency, with people who are fearful of another government shutdown over this wall?**

*And also, I want to ask you about Jussie Smollett. Have you heard about that story? In Chicago, a situation -- the actor from "Empire" who was allegedly attacked with racist and homophobic --**

*That, I can tell you, is horrible. I've seen it last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I'm concerned. As far as the people are concerned, many of those people wanted me to stay out, but I didn’t want to do it because people were getting hurt. People -- what I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we're allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic, and do all of these horrible things.**

*That if we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country. That, to me, is the great sin. And everybody knows it works. I watched this morning, early in the morning, somebody trying to justify walls are immoral. I mean, if walls are immoral, maybe we should take down all the walls that are built right now.**

*You will see a mess like you've never seen before. So I only say this: I was elected partially on this issue -- not as much as people say, but partially on this issue. This is a very important issue. Nothing to do with elections. Nothing to do with votes. Nothing. Only to do with common sense and only to do with security.**

*And if we don’t put up a barrier or wall -- a strong one, but one that looks good -- in the old days, they used to build them; they looked terrible. Now we build them, they look really good. If we don’t put up a physical barrier, you can forget it. Our country is going to be a very unsafe place. People are coming in. Drugs are coming in. Human trafficking is coming in, which is so horrible.**

*Things are happening that won't happen after the wall is constructed. So we're building a lot of wall. We're building new sections that are starting in about two weeks. We're building some brand new sections -- large sections. And the wall is getting built. I would like to build it even faster, but it's getting built, and it's getting built very substantially, as some of you see because you've been there.**

*Yeah, please.**

*I have an immigration question. But first, if I could just clarify something you said about North Korea. Do you have an agreement with North Korea on the time and place for that next summit?**

*Yes. I do.**

*Can you share it?**

*Yeah, we're going to very soon. We're going to announce it pretty soon. We'll be announcing it early next week.**

*Okay. And you also said that --**

*And they very much want the meeting, and I think they really want to do something. We'll see. But I think they really want. But again, remember, North Korea was a whole different story. When I came to office, many people thought we were going to war with North Korea. I would sit and listen, and I would read people saying, "Go to war with North Korea." Well, you'd lose, I mean potentially, hundreds of millions of lives.**

*You know, Seoul has 30-some-odd million people, and it's literally right off their wall, by the way. But that wall works, I can tell you.**

*About the wall, you just said that people make that out to be a bigger deal on your election than you --**

*Well, it was one of my points. I had -- yeah.**

*I mean, you would consider that the biggest campaign --**

*Now they say it's the wall, because I've accomplished practically everything else. Look, I accomplished the military. I accomplished the tax cuts. I accomplished the regulation cuts. I accomplished so much. The economy is the number-one economy in the world. We're the number-one economy in the world. We're the number one, not even close.**

*Companies are pouring into our country. I've accomplished so much. So now they say, "Oh, if he doesn’t get the wall…" -- they make that the only issue. But it's not going to work, because I'm building the wall. The wall is happening right now, okay?**

*The government has been reopened for several days now. Are you closer or farther apart on an immigration deal, now that -- since you opened the government?**

*With respect to the committee?**

*Yes.**

*I would say we're the same. Because I'm hearing they don’t want to do a wall, for political reasons. I actually think it's bad politics. I mean, frankly, I think them fighting us on what everybody knows has to be done to have proper security. And you can add the other things, but the other things only really work if you have the physical barrier.**

*Without the physical barrier, you just won't -- what are you going to have? Drones flying over the 12,000 people? You're going to have a nice drone flying -- doing circles around the 12,000 people that are walking in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador? No, you don’t want that. So I want to do real things, like the deal with China.**

*I want it to be a real deal. I could do a deal with China, where people would say, "Isn't that wonderful?" It's not wonderful. I have to do the real deal. We have to open up China. We're open to them. They have to be open to us. So, it would be so easy for me to make a deal with China, but it wouldn’t be a real deal.**

*I could get them to buy more corn than they've ever bought, and more soybeans than they've ever bought. And they'd be so happy if I did that. But they're going to do that, but in even higher numbers. But we're going to do a lot of other things. And just remember, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China.**

*We never took in 10 cents from China. China is being charged tremendous amounts of money for the privilege of coming in and doing what they do to our country. They're being charged a tremendous amount of money. And we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal with China, but it's going to be a very comprehensive deal.**

*We're going to cover everything, okay?**

*You mentioned all the economic indicators are going up. Why then is the -- are U.S. deficits and the financial debt increasing at a time when the economy is --**

*Well, the trade deals won't kick in for a while. You know, number one, the USMCA hasn’t even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. During the campaign, I said I will either terminate NAFTA or negotiate a new deal.**

*And we negotiated a good deal. Now, if you went back to pre-NAFTA, that would be, frankly, okay with me. Pre-NAFTA or the new deal. But I won't allow NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal for this country. If you look at the scars all over our country, where you go to New England, you go to Ohio, you go to Pennsylvania, you see what -- I mean, what happened in North Carolina -- you have factories that are still empty from what happened with NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal.**

*The USMCA is a great deal. But pre-NAFTA was -- we had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.**

*One more on the wall. You said the wall is being basically held hostage for political reasons by the Democrats. Is there anything you would have done differently in the first two years to get this --**

*No, there's nothing -- look, they had this from day one.**

*-- [Inaudible] wall finished --**

*Could I have done it differently? No, not really. I mean, I think what -- by having the shutdown, we've set the table for where we are now. If I didn’t do the shutdown, people wouldn’t know -- they wouldn’t understand the subject. Now they understand the subject. They realize what a humanitarian crisis it is. It's sort of -- it's called, like in deal-making, "setting the table," or, you know, setting the stage.**

*We've set the stage for what's going to happen on the 15th of February. I don’t think they're going to make a deal. I see what's happening. They're all saying, "Oh, let's do this, but we're not giving one dime for the wall." That's okay. But if they're not going to give money for the wall, it's not going to work.**

*And if it's not going to work, then the politicians are really wasting a lot of time. Okay.**

*Mr. President, will you declare a national emergency if there's no money for the wall?**

*I would do that. I would do that.**

*So why hasn’t --**

*We have money. Just so you understand: We have money. We're building the wall right now -- a lot of it. People don’t know that, and nobody reports it, but that's okay. Because it's not very exciting when you say it's built. You know, people. But let me just tell you: We're building the wall right now. It's going up fairly rapidly.**

*We're renovating tremendous amounts of wall, which is good stuff that's in very bad shape with massive holes in it and fencing coming down. It's being beautifully renovated. In some cases, we have to replace it. We renovate some. We replace some. We build some new. But the wall is going up right now in all different forms.**

*Thank you very much, everybody.**

*What's been holding you back from declaring a national emergency?**

*We're going to see what happens on February 15th.**

*Are you concerned about legal challenges?**

*Against who?**

*Are you concerned about legal challenges?**

*No, I'm not concerned. I'm not concerned.**

*But you still don’t think there's going to be a deal, but you're not going to declare it now. Don’t you think that --**

*I'm waiting -- excuse me. I didn’t say that. I said I'm waiting until February 15th. On February 15th, the committee will come back, and if they don’t have a wall, I don’t even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time. Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall.**

*Now, when you couple the wall with sensors and drones and all of these other things, that works, as a combination. But if you don’t have a wall, they're all just wasting their time. It's just politics. Thank you all very much.**

*Open borders are very bad for our country. Crime comes in. Drugs, human trafficking, so many things. But let's talk about human trafficking. You can't bring women or children through a port of entry, where you have people looking into the back of a car or a van, a truck.**

*It has to go out into the open areas, where they drive into our country like there's no problem, and that's exactly what they do. They get off the main drag, or the main road. They make a right, or a left, and then they come right into our country. They go through areas where there is nobody.**

*We need a border wall. If we don't have a wall to stop them, nothing's going to stop them. This isn't about technology, and this isn't about politics. This is about practicality, and it's about security for our nation.**

*Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the Vice Premier of China with us, and also the Vice Minister of Trade of China. We have had long discussions. This has been going on for quite some time. It will be, by far, if it happens, the biggest deal ever made -- not only the biggest trade deal ever made.**

*It will be the biggest trade deal by far, but it'll also be the biggest deal ever made. The two largest countries doing a trade deal. There won't be anything that will match that. And we'll see what happens. We've done very well. We've had a very, very strong relationship, as my relationship is with President Xi. I think we'll start by reading the letter that President Xi sent to me and to us. It puts us off to a good foot.**

*And then we'll also repeat a couple of the remarks that the Vice Premier stated. And then we are going to have Mr. Lighthizer speak for a couple of seconds. And we're then going to get back to business, and you can go and have fun and write your stories. So thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. And if you could start by reading the letter from President Xi, and maybe you could speak louder.**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*That's a beautiful letter and we appreciate it. You may go with the Vice Premier's statements, and then I'm going to ask for you to say a few words, Bob, if you don’t mind. Please.**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*Well, thank you very much. Bob, maybe you could say just a few words as to where we are, how we're doing, what we're discussing. And then maybe I'll ask the Vice Premier to say a few words, and we'll get on with our negotiations.**

*Great. Thank you, Mr. President.**

*Perhaps, go ahead, if you want to say that. [Interpreter speaks] Got it? He speaks very good English.**

*Based on many months of negotiations, we had two very intense, very long days of discussions. Your team was -- all of your team was involved. I think we've made progress. We have much work to do if we're going to have an agreement, but we made substantial progress. We focused on the most important issues, which are the structural issues and the protection of U.S. intellectual property, stopping forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, agriculture and services issues, and enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.**

*Both sides agree this agreement is worth nothing -- if we can get an agreement, it's worth nothing without enforcement. That's been your instruction from the beginning. So we're focusing -- we have a lot more issues to cover, but we focused on the structural issues -- the ones that you've been so focused on -- and we talked about enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.**

*And you'll be going in early February, with your group, to China to continue negotiations.**

*We are more or less -- Mr. President, we are more or less in continuous negotiations. There will be a brief pause for the Chinese New Year -- briefer than the Chinese want -- but our people will be in contact. We're going back and forth with papers and with discussions. The Secretary and I will be going over there shortly, and then we'll see where we are.**

*At this point, it's impossible for me to predict success, but we are in a place that, if things work, it could happen.**

*Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And we look forward to that, and we look forward to the results of your trip. But you're really discussing it anyway, whether you're in China or here. We have a thing called the telephone and other means of talking. So I know you're spending a lot of time, and it's moving along well.**

*So I just want to say the Vice Premier is a friend of mine. He has become -- he is truly one of the most respected men in Asia, one of the most respected men in all of China, and, frankly, one of the most respected men anywhere in the world. And it's a great honor to have you with us.**

*[Via Translator] Thank you.**

*And if you'd like to say a few words -- please, Liu.**

*[Via Translator] It's an honor to meet you, Mr. President. I don’t think you can hear me. And I fully agree with the report that satisfies Ambassador Lighthizer, and we actually have to establish three key themes. First about [Inaudible]. And secondly, about drugs coming through. And thirdly, about enforcement or implementation.**

*[Via Translator] But, at the same time, we'll also discuss something from China: the need to do something where [Inaudible] U.S. some problem with [Inaudible]. So I thank you so much to be with you, and I'm waiting for [Inaudible] in Beijing [Inaudible], and I hope we will make a deal.**

*We'll be going. And we look forward to that. And then a little back-and-forth, and ultimately, I know that I'll be meeting with President Xi, maybe once and maybe twice, and it'll all seem -- it seems to be coming together. I do appreciate the fact that you said so much about our farmers and that you'll be doing purchases quickly about the farmers.**

*That's really wonderful.**

*[Via Translator] Five -- five million.**

*Five million --**

*Five million tons of soybeans.**

*Five million tons of soybeans. Wow.**

*[Via Translator] Per day.**

*Per day. That's going to make our farmers very happy. That's a lot of soybeans. That's really nice. And I know they said some other things, and we'll put out a release for the press. But the relationship is very, very good between China and the United States. And the personal relationships are very good, with the Vice Premier, with myself and President Xi, and with our representatives.**

*It's been very, very good. And, you know, you read a lot of things. Sometimes you hear good, sometimes you don’t hear good. But I will say that I think that the relationship that we have right now with China has never been so advanced. I don’t think it's ever been better. But I can you tell you for a fact, it's never been so advanced.**

*And certainly a deal has never been so advanced. Because, essentially, we don’t have a deal. We never had a trade deal. We're going to have a great trade deal. But we never really had a trade deal with China, and now we're going to have a great trade deal with China, if it all works out. And we look forward to it. It's going to be great for both countries -- not just us, not just them.**

*This is going to be great for both countries. And I know you've already done a lot of opening up China to the financial services industry. It's been happening very much, very rapidly. And hopefully we can get that done for our farmers, our manufacturers, and likewise, the United States. So it's just an honor to be with you.**

*And I will see you today, but I'll see you a lot over the next month, that I can tell you. Okay? Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you.**

*Mr. President, when do you want to meet with President Xi?**

*We haven’t set up a meeting yet. I think we're working on seeing where everybody is, and then we'll meet to discuss some final issues. It may be a lot, it may be a small amount. But I have a feeling it will be agreed to pretty quickly by both countries. Both countries would like to see a positive result.**

*And have you seen enough progress, based on what you've heard from your team so far, on IP and technology transfers?**

*Yeah. Yeah, very much. Technology transfer, IT. I think that we have made tremendous progress. That doesn’t mean you're going to have a deal, but I can say that there is a tremendous relationship and warm feeling, and we've made tremendous progress.**

*Mr. President, did you talk to your intelligence chiefs today about the displeasure you had with their [Inaudible]?**

*I did. And they said that they were totally misquoted and they were totally -- it was taken out of context. So what I'd do is I'd suggest that you call them. They said it was fake news, so -- which, frankly, didn’t surprise me.**

*We just ran exactly what they said to Congress.**

*Excuse me. Excuse me. It didn’t surprise me at all. But we're here to talk right now about China.**

*Did the fact they didn’t bring up the border as the world threat assessment, did that undermine or undercut what you have said -- that there's a crisis at the border?**

*It didn’t undermine anything. We need a wall. And if we don’t have a wall, we're never going to have security for our country.**

*But they didn’t bring it up as part of the national security assessment.**

*Next.**

*Does that undercut --**

*Please.**

*Is there any more detail about the soybean offer and deal?**

*Well, I think it's so nice that -- you said soybeans?**

*Yes, sir.**

*That's a tremendous purchase, which will take place now. And our farmers are going to be very happy.**

*When does that start?**

*When is the soybean taking place?**

*[Via Translator] They have already [Inaudible].**

*They've already started.**

*[Via Translator] And they will start another [Inaudible].**

*So they've started on a smaller scale, and today they're starting very big. And I very much appreciate that. Please tell President Xi. And on behalf of the agricultural industry, and on behalf of our farmers, frankly, we appreciate it very much. It's a very big order.**

*[Via Translator] Chinese people like U.S. farmers very much.**

*They like the U.S. farmers. Well, we have good product. And you can use it, and it's --**

*[Via Translator] [Inaudible]**

*No, but I really appreciated that. That was really fantastic to say. And that's before we make a deal. It's a fantastic sign of faith.**

*Mr. President, was the Huawei case discussed during negotiations?**

*No, we haven’t discussed that yet. It will be, but it hasn’t been discussed yet.**

*In what aspect? How will it be discussed?**

*Well, it will be discussed. I'm sure at some point that'll be -- that, actually, as big as it might seem, is very small compared to the overall deal, but that will be discussed. Anything else?**

*Mr. President, is the plan [Inaudible] the trips to see Xi and to meet Chairman Kim again?**

*Excuse me?**

*Would you combine the trips to see Chairman Kim for your meeting again?**

*It's possible. We'll see how it is. We haven't discussed it yet. When President Xi and I meet, we want to have it down so that we have certain points that we can discuss and, I would say, agree to. But we're not quite at that stage yet. But all of these representatives and these representatives are coming to a conclusion, except for certain very important points.**

*And we want to make it comprehensive. We want to make a deal that we can look at and be proud of for many years -- not where we have to go back and renegotiate, or we left things out. So whether it's intellectual property or whether it's any of the other things that we discuss all the time, we want to try -- would you say?**

*-- have everything included. We want to have it very comprehensive.**

*What are the specific points that you feel like you need to negotiate one on one with him personally?**

*Well, we really -- we really have discussed many of those points today. But I would say, probably more than any other thing, every single point that you discuss in the newspapers and on television. Those are the points that we're discussing. I don’t think I've ever heard of any point that was discussed by the folks that really represent you, and represent you well.**

*It's every single one of those points have been discussed in our transactions and our trade deal -- in this trade deal.**

*Mr. President, you said earlier you would be willing to postpone this. What did you mean by that? Do you want to extend the deadline? Or what did you mean by that?**

*We haven’t talked about extending the deadline. The deadline is March 1st. That deadline has stayed, and we really haven’t talked about it. Maybe we don't -- I don't think we have to extend. Now, at a certain point, you're going to have -- this is a very complex, and a very large -- it’s the largest transaction ever made, to be perfectly straight.**

*We have to get this put on paper at some point if we agree. There are some points that we don’t agree to yet, but I think we will agree. I think, when President Xi and myself meet, every point will be agreed to. One of the things that we discussed in Argentina was fentanyl. This is not a trade deal, this is a fact that President Xi was extremely good when he said that they would criminalize fentanyl, because fentanyl is killing a lot of our great American people.**

*And if they did what they are going to do, it would very much halt or at least -- I think it would stop fentanyl from coming into this country, which would be a tremendous thing. And so that’s a separate than a trade deal, but it’s a very important thing.**

*Mr. Lighthizer mentioned enforcement. How do you envision an enforcement mechanism working?**

*Well, I think we're going to have strong enforcement language both ways. They want enforcement, too. And I think we're going to have it both ways, and we'll have strong enforcement language. This is a serious deal that we're doing. This could be done very quickly, very easily, but it wouldn’t be comprehensive; it would be small.**

*And I just want to end by saying it really is a sign of good faith for China to buy that much of our soybeans and other product that they've just committed to us prior to the signing of the deal -- is something that makes us very proud to be dealing with them. I think that the farmers who have already been notified of this by me and my representatives -- and by Sonny.**

*Sonny Perdue is here, the Secretary of Agriculture. I think that was music to your ears, Sonny.**

*Absolutely. Good news.**

*And that’s a big number. That’s a big number even for you to hear. Right?**

*Good news. Our folks will be happy.**

*Will you let the farmers know right away?**

*They'll know before I [Inaudible]. [Laughter]**

*And that was more than even soybeans -- that was the other things that we discussed before the press came in. They discussed other things that they are buying also. So, Sonny, if you let everybody know, that would be great.**

*We'd be happy to do that.**

*Were you surprised to hear that?**

*Pleased to hear that.**

*Ah, that’s going to keep the farmers busy. That’s going to keep them busy. That’s a big order. So let's keep going. Let's start our discussions and we'll ask the media to leave. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.**

*Is Secretary Mnuchin going over with Ambassador Lighthizer?**

*I think so. Steve, you're going?**

*Yes, I'll go with Ambassador Lighthizer.**

*Are you going? Are you going, too? Ask Mnuchin. She wanted to know about Mnuchin.**

*Is there a date for that?**

*We have a tentative date we need to confirm in the next couple of days.**

*What about the summit with North Korean leaders?**

*It's moving along well. The end of the month. The end of February.**

*Any other details you can provide?**

*Early next week, probably State of the Union. Okay?**

*[Inaudible] President Xi?**

*One way or the other.**

*Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the Vice Premier of China with us, and also the Vice Minister of Trade of China. We have had long discussions. This has been going on for quite some time. It will be, by far, if it happens, the biggest deal ever made -- not only the biggest trade deal ever made.**

*It will be the biggest trade deal by far, but it'll also be the biggest deal ever made. The two largest countries doing a trade deal. There won't be anything that will match that. And we'll see what happens. We've done very well. We've had a very, very strong relationship, as my relationship is with President Xi. I think we'll start by reading the letter that President Xi sent to me and to us. It puts us off to a good foot.**

*And then we'll also repeat a couple of the remarks that the Vice Premier stated. And then we are going to have Mr. Lighthizer speak for a couple of seconds. And we're then going to get back to business, and you can go and have fun and write your stories. So thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. And if you could start by reading the letter from President Xi, and maybe you could speak louder.**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*That's a beautiful letter and we appreciate it. You may go with the Vice Premier's statements, and then I'm going to ask for you to say a few words, Bob, if you don’t mind. Please.**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*[Via Translator]**

*Well, thank you very much. Bob, maybe you could say just a few words as to where we are, how we're doing, what we're discussing. And then maybe I'll ask the Vice Premier to say a few words, and we'll get on with our negotiations.**

*Great. Thank you, Mr. President.**

*Perhaps, go ahead, if you want to say that. [Interpreter speaks] Got it? He speaks very good English.**

*Based on many months of negotiations, we had two very intense, very long days of discussions. Your team was -- all of your team was involved. I think we've made progress. We have much work to do if we're going to have an agreement, but we made substantial progress. We focused on the most important issues, which are the structural issues and the protection of U.S. intellectual property, stopping forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, agriculture and services issues, and enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.**

*Both sides agree this agreement is worth nothing -- if we can get an agreement, it's worth nothing without enforcement. That's been your instruction from the beginning. So we're focusing -- we have a lot more issues to cover, but we focused on the structural issues -- the ones that you've been so focused on -- and we talked about enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.**

*And you'll be going in early February, with your group, to China to continue negotiations.**

*We are more or less -- Mr. President, we are more or less in continuous negotiations. There will be a brief pause for the Chinese New Year -- briefer than the Chinese want -- but our people will be in contact. We're going back and forth with papers and with discussions. The Secretary and I will be going over there shortly, and then we'll see where we are.**

*At this point, it's impossible for me to predict success, but we are in a place that, if things work, it could happen.**

*Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And we look forward to that, and we look forward to the results of your trip. But you're really discussing it anyway, whether you're in China or here. We have a thing called the telephone and other means of talking. So I know you're spending a lot of time, and it's moving along well.**

*So I just want to say the Vice Premier is a friend of mine. He has become -- he is truly one of the most respected men in Asia, one of the most respected men in all of China, and, frankly, one of the most respected men anywhere in the world. And it's a great honor to have you with us.**

*[Via Translator] Thank you.**

*And if you'd like to say a few words -- please, Liu.**

*[Via Translator] It's an honor to meet you, Mr. President. I don’t think you can hear me. And I fully agree with the report that satisfies Ambassador Lighthizer, and we actually have to establish three key themes. First about [Inaudible]. And secondly, about drugs coming through. And thirdly, about enforcement or implementation.**

*[Via Translator] But, at the same time, we'll also discuss something from China: the need to do something where [Inaudible] U.S. some problem with [Inaudible]. So I thank you so much to be with you, and I'm waiting for [Inaudible] in Beijing [Inaudible], and I hope we will make a deal.**

*We'll be going. And we look forward to that. And then a little back-and-forth, and ultimately, I know that I'll be meeting with President Xi, maybe once and maybe twice, and it'll all seem -- it seems to be coming together. I do appreciate the fact that you said so much about our farmers and that you'll be doing purchases quickly about the farmers.**

*That's really wonderful.**

*[Via Translator] Five -- five million.**

*Five million --**

*Five million tons of soybeans.**

*Five million tons of soybeans. Wow.**

*[Via Translator] Per day.**

*Per day. That's going to make our farmers very happy. That's a lot of soybeans. That's really nice. And I know they said some other things, and we'll put out a release for the press. But the relationship is very, very good between China and the United States. And the personal relationships are very good, with the Vice Premier, with myself and President Xi, and with our representatives.**

*It's been very, very good. And, you know, you read a lot of things. Sometimes you hear good, sometimes you don’t hear good. But I will say that I think that the relationship that we have right now with China has never been so advanced. I don’t think it's ever been better. But I can you tell you for a fact, it's never been so advanced.**

*And certainly a deal has never been so advanced. Because, essentially, we don’t have a deal. We never had a trade deal. We're going to have a great trade deal. But we never really had a trade deal with China, and now we're going to have a great trade deal with China, if it all works out. And we look forward to it. It's going to be great for both countries -- not just us, not just them.**

*This is going to be great for both countries. And I know you've already done a lot of opening up China to the financial services industry. It's been happening very much, very rapidly. And hopefully we can get that done for our farmers, our manufacturers, and likewise, the United States. So it's just an honor to be with you.**

*And I will see you today, but I'll see you a lot over the next month, that I can tell you. Okay? Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you.**

*Mr. President, when do you want to meet with President Xi?**

*We haven’t set up a meeting yet. I think we're working on seeing where everybody is, and then we'll meet to discuss some final issues. It may be a lot, it may be a small amount. But I have a feeling it will be agreed to pretty quickly by both countries. Both countries would like to see a positive result.**

*And have you seen enough progress, based on what you've heard from your team so far, on IP and technology transfers?**

*Yeah. Yeah, very much. Technology transfer, IT. I think that we have made tremendous progress. That doesn’t mean you're going to have a deal, but I can say that there is a tremendous relationship and warm feeling, and we've made tremendous progress.**

*Mr. President, did you talk to your intelligence chiefs today about the displeasure you had with their [Inaudible]?**

*I did. And they said that they were totally misquoted and they were totally -- it was taken out of context. So what I'd do is I'd suggest that you call them. They said it was fake news, so -- which, frankly, didn’t surprise me.**

*We just ran exactly what they said to Congress.**

*Excuse me. Excuse me. It didn’t surprise me at all. But we're here to talk right now about China.**

*Did the fact they didn’t bring up the border as the world threat assessment, did that undermine or undercut what you have said -- that there's a crisis at the border?**

*It didn’t undermine anything. We need a wall. And if we don’t have a wall, we're never going to have security for our country.**

*But they didn’t bring it up as part of the national security assessment.**

*Next.**

*Does that undercut --**

*Please.**

*Is there any more detail about the soybean offer and deal?**

*Well, I think it's so nice that -- you said soybeans?**

*Yes, sir.**

*That's a tremendous purchase, which will take place now. And our farmers are going to be very happy.**

*When does that start?**

*When is the soybean taking place?**

*[Via Translator] They have already [Inaudible].**

*They've already started.**

*[Via Translator] And they will start another [Inaudible].**

*So they've started on a smaller scale, and today they're starting very big. And I very much appreciate that. Please tell President Xi. And on behalf of the agricultural industry, and on behalf of our farmers, frankly, we appreciate it very much. It's a very big order.**

*[Via Translator] Chinese people like U.S. farmers very much.**

*They like the U.S. farmers. Well, we have good product. And you can use it, and it's --**

*[Via Translator] [Inaudible]**

*No, but I really appreciated that. That was really fantastic to say. And that's before we make a deal. It's a fantastic sign of faith.**

*Mr. President, was the Huawei case discussed during negotiations?**

*No, we haven’t discussed that yet. It will be, but it hasn’t been discussed yet.**

*In what aspect? How will it be discussed?**

*Well, it will be discussed. I'm sure at some point that'll be -- that, actually, as big as it might seem, is very small compared to the overall deal, but that will be discussed. Anything else?**

*Mr. President, is the plan [Inaudible] the trips to see Xi and to meet Chairman Kim again?**

*Excuse me?**

*Would you combine the trips to see Chairman Kim for your meeting again?**

*It's possible. We'll see how it is. We haven't discussed it yet. When President Xi and I meet, we want to have it down so that we have certain points that we can discuss and, I would say, agree to. But we're not quite at that stage yet. But all of these representatives and these representatives are coming to a conclusion, except for certain very important points.**

*And we want to make it comprehensive. We want to make a deal that we can look at and be proud of for many years -- not where we have to go back and renegotiate, or we left things out. So whether it's intellectual property or whether it's any of the other things that we discuss all the time, we want to try -- would you say?**

*-- have everything included. We want to have it very comprehensive.**

*What are the specific points that you feel like you need to negotiate one on one with him personally?**

*Well, we really -- we really have discussed many of those points today. But I would say, probably more than any other thing, every single point that you discuss in the newspapers and on television. Those are the points that we're discussing. I don’t think I've ever heard of any point that was discussed by the folks that really represent you, and represent you well.**

*It's every single one of those points have been discussed in our transactions and our trade deal -- in this trade deal.**

*Mr. President, you said earlier you would be willing to postpone this. What did you mean by that? Do you want to extend the deadline? Or what did you mean by that?**

*We haven’t talked about extending the deadline. The deadline is March 1st. That deadline has stayed, and we really haven’t talked about it. Maybe we don't -- I don't think we have to extend. Now, at a certain point, you're going to have -- this is a very complex, and a very large -- it’s the largest transaction ever made, to be perfectly straight.**

*We have to get this put on paper at some point if we agree. There are some points that we don’t agree to yet, but I think we will agree. I think, when President Xi and myself meet, every point will be agreed to. One of the things that we discussed in Argentina was fentanyl. This is not a trade deal, this is a fact that President Xi was extremely good when he said that they would criminalize fentanyl, because fentanyl is killing a lot of our great American people.**

This is a serious deal that we're doing. This could be done very quickly, very easily, but it wouldn’t be comprehensive; it would be small.**

*And that was more than even soybeans -- that was the other things that we discussed before the press came in. They discussed other things that they are buying also. So, Sonny, if you let everybody know, that would be great.**

*We'd be happy to do that.**

*Were you surprised to hear that?**

*Pleased to hear that.**

*Stephen Paddock, the shooter in Las Vegas in 2017. The FBI just closed its investigation yesterday without determining any motive. But don't you think Americans deserve to know why so many people died in the worst mass shooting in modern history?**

*It was a horrible event. He was a very, very sick person, obviously. It was very unusual in that there didn't seem to be your standard set of reasons as to why this would happen. I'm a little surprised that the report wasn't much longer but at the same time I can understand it. It was just a -- just a terrible thing.**

*They were unable to find a real reason other than, obviously, he was sick and they didn't know it. So, I was a little surprised and a lot disappointed that they weren't able to find the reason. Because you'd like to find a reason for that.**

*Were you following the developments through that case?**

*I was watching it like everybody else. I thought it was horrible. I went to the hospital, I saw many of the victims and right after the event it was horrible. It was inconceivable. But he was a very sick person and nobody would've known it. Nobody had any idea. He had money -- or at least they think he had money.**

*He was a gambler, you know, you don't see too many gamblers that have money. I think they worked very hard. I will tell you they worked very hard on that case. They just were unable to find anything from all of the facts. Because I've looked at some of the things also and it was a very unusual case of a very sick person who just, people never saw that coming.**

*Speaking of the FBI, sir, were you comfortable with the way and the force that was used against the raid in Roger Stone's house? Do you think that was appropriate for your FBI to be doing that in a white collar case?**

*I thought it was very unusual. You know, I've stayed out of that whole situation so that -- because there was no collusion whatsoever. There was no nothing done wrong and frankly, I could have waded in very early, I could have ended it very easily if I wanted to but just let it run its course. But I will say, like, I'm speaking for a lot of people that were very disappointed to see that go down that way, to see it happen where it was on camera, on top of it. That was a very, very disappointing scene --**

*You thought it was unusual that CNN was there?**

*— You have 29 people and you have armored vehicles and you had all of the other and, you know, many people know Roger, and Roger is not a person that they would have to worry about from that standpoint. I thought it was sad to see it.**

*Would you ask the FBI to review its use of force, its militarization when it handles cases like this?**

*I think it's a good question for you to ask, and it's something I'll think about.**

*One last question related to that. On the Paddock case, all of America was really interested to find out what happened there.**

*Including me.**

*Of course. And I wonder how many resources in the FBI were committed to the Paddock case versus committed to the Mueller investigation. How much money was spent? How many people were on those things? How do those two things compare?**

*What a great question that is. It's one of the better questions. I hope you're going to play your question because that is a very, very interesting -- you're talking about, I guess they're well over 30 million dollars now on this Russian collusion hoax, and everybody knows it's a hoax. They've spent all this money.**

*Nothing. No phone calls, no meetings, no nothing. You look at it, and you say, isn't that sad to have devoted this time, this energy over a -- you know, look, there's been numerous books written right now, including number one best sellers, calling it a "hoax." And it is very sad. That is very sad. By the way, to me, both very sad events.**

*But that is very interesting to ask, where you've had so many people killed, and so badly wounded, because I went to the hospital. You had people so badly wounded. People never talk about the wounded. The level of hurt and devastation for a whole lifetime. You know, many people just devastated for a lifetime.**

*They'll never be the same. And you look at that by comparison to the Russian hoax, it's a shame. The Russian witch hunt, it's a shame.**

*Speaking of that, sir, Matt Whitaker came out I think a couple of days ago. He said that the Mueller probe seems to be wrapping up, generally. Has he communicated that to you?**

*No. No, I haven't spoken to him about that. I would say that I think after almost two years it certainly should be. Process crimes or process, you know, questions, the answer is different than what you thought it might be and some people say they lost their memory or a lack of memory, which a lot of people can understand that too.**

*No, I never spoke to him about that.**

*So Whitaker or whoever is heading as the attorney general at the time will get to make a decision about releasing the report that Mueller sends him --**

*I don't know what --**

*Is that the kind of thing you'll sign off on if and when it comes to that decision?**

*They'll have to make their decision within the Justice Department. They will make the decision as to what they do. I could've taken a much different stance, I could've gotten involved in this, I could've terminated everything. I could've ended everything. I've chosen to stay out of it. But I had the right to, as you know, I had the right if I wanted to to end everything.**

*I could've just said, "that's enough." Many people thought that's what I should do.**

*You know, Andrew McCarthy has made the case that the reason Comey was recommended to be fired by Rod Rosenstein is that he went out in public and he made a public indictment of Hillary Clinton without actually recommending a prosecution. In other words, he made a character indictment of her in the court of public opinion.**

*In Andrew McCarthy's view, if this report comes out from Mueller and it does anything to try and go after you for any reason that doesn't have any criminality involved, that would be a disservice to you. That's not justice if the Justice Department is trying to say things to hurt your character but they don't have anything to do with criminality.**

*Well, I never had anything to do with the Russians having to do with this. I ran a great campaign. I ran a campaign that now they say was better than that gentleman's campaign in the 1800s and we did a great job. And we got 306 to 223 and that's that. Won states that nobody thought were possible to win. Remember the expression, "he cannot get to 270." And we got way beyond 270. And I don't even say she ran a bad campaign.**

*I think I ran a very good campaign.**

*Well the people who elected you are very interested in the immigration decision and what's going on with this negotiation. Republicans in charge of Congress for two years didn't get to your wall promise in Congress. How big of a roadblock to wall funding was Paul Ryan now that he's gone?**

*Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, "Please don't do that, we'll get you the wall." And I said, "I hope you mean that because I don't like this bill," although I love the bill for what it did for the military. And therefore, if it weren't for the military I would have vetoed it. Just so you understand, our military needed funding desperately.**

*Totally depleted. And this bill was great for the military. Had I vetoed it, you would never have gotten the numbers back that I got: $700 and $716 billion over the last two years. Which is substantially more -- much more than President Obama was able to get for the military. So that was a negative but a big factor as to why that was the reason I signed it. But another very big factor was the fact that Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, "please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall." Which is desperately needed by our country.**

*Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything -- people, criminals, gangs, so we need the wall. And then he went lame duck. And once he went lame duck it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone, so I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed.**

*And it is. And I'll get the wall.**

*Did he lie to you? Did he play you?**

*I don't want to say he lied. I think he probably meant it at the time, I guess. I hope. So I don't call that lying. But when he went lame duck, meaning, he said he's not running again -- and it was very unusual because usually they'll do that sometime after an election and he didn't want to do that because it's somewhat misrepresenting and I understand that too.**

*But maybe you don't run, okay? Maybe you just don't run. And he had an excellent person taking his place in Congress, he ran a great campaign, did a really good job. So Paul said, "please sign the omnibus bill." Now, in all fairness to Paul, I may have signed it anyway because it was so much more money than anyone ever thought possible for the military, and equal to the wall and maybe even greater than the wall was my promise to refurbish the military.**

*You know, I made many statements, many promises. In fact, here are some of them, folks. But those are some of the things we've accomplished. VA choice, VA accountability -- you know, these are things that for decades and decades and I got a lot of these things. Tax cuts, regulation cuts by far the most that anybody's ever got, biggest tax cuts.**

*And that's why you look at the market -- we just hit over 25,000. We're back where we were, right? So anyway, that's the story.**

*One thing that some conservatives are worried about is that you're prepared to give away some status for illegal immigrants in exchange for the things that you want. So when it comes to DACA, in these negotiations that are going on on Capitol Hill, how far are you willing to go there?**

*So I don't know if you saw -- you know, there was a couple of days ago, "he's going to give up DACA, he's going to —" First of all, it's not mine to give up right now because DACA is going to the Supreme Court, hopefully. But miraculously, and horribly, they lost DACA. This was a case that President Obama said, essentially, he doesn't have the right to sign.**

*But they went, as usual, to the Ninth Circuit and they won a case, they won an appeal, and now it's hopefully going to the Supreme Court soon because this is a very important case. We should win that case easily, you know, it should be won. Now, if it is won, then we'll talk about DACA but right now -- when that case was lost we were very close to making a deal.**

*And then a judge in the Ninth Circuit agreed that President Obama, although President Obama didn't think he had a right to do it, he said that -- as soon as that was done, I said, "that's the end of that deal." We had a deal for some DACA -- for a lot of things. But we had a deal done and I said to people when that case was lost -- well, it wasn't lost permanently, I think we're going to ultimately win -- that's the time I want to talk about it.**

*So DACA is tabled until the court resolves it?**

*Well I said to people, I saw yesterday, "well, what about DACA," I said, "it's highly unlikely." I was tougher than anybody else on that. I could see doing something for DACA but I want to find out what the Supreme Court's gonna do first.**

*Chuck Schumer said he doesn't want the White House playing a role in negotiations on Capitol Hill—**

*I don't blame him.**

*How much of a role are you going to play?**

*Because he doesn't want me to make the deal. He doesn't want to make me -- because my idea of a deal is different than other people's. Without our involvement a deal's not going to get done and I think we're going to -- look, that deal. Look, there are numerous things we could do, including declaring a national emergency where we have very good law on our side, including the fact that I'm already building a tremendous amount of wall.**

*People don't realize that. I'm going to be announcing the exact numbers but I'll have over a hundred miles of wall either built or under construction between new and renovated. Over a hundred miles. We have a tremendous amount of money right now to build a wall. We're building the wall. I'll be announcing some numbers on -- but in addition to that we declare a national emergency if this doesn't work out.**

*I believe you have a military base in Yuma, Arizona. Are you going to do some wall there? Is that the plan?**

*We have, I believe, that area -- yes. We have a tremendous problem in that area. It's very interesting, California, you know, they always say, "don't build a wall," well, they were begging me to build a wall over in San Diego. The day I finished they said, "don't build a wall." But they were begging me to build the wall because people were pouring in through that border, through that area.**

*We built a brand new wall. That's not a renovated wall, that's a brand new wall. We took down the old wall, we built a brand new wall. It's fantastic, looks great, they did a great job, totally stopped everybody from coming in. The day we completed it California started saying, "don't build a wall, we don't want a wall." They want drones, right?**

*Flying up around.**

*You talked about the courts, sir. Are you keeping an eye right now on Justice Ginsburg's health?**

*Well, look, I hope that she's healthy, I hope she's happy, and I hope she lives for a long time.**

*Would you commit to replacing her with somebody who was on that list -- somebody like Amy Barrett who a lot of conservatives have looked at?**

*Well I've been very religious. I've very much confined myself to that list, as you know. And that list has great people on it and I would say it's highly likely I would stay. I think one of the things --**

*But Amy Barrett would be a choice?**

*No, she would certainly be a choice. I think anybody on that list would be a choice. They're great people. I've been told, and I don't know that that's true, I would be surprised if it's true, but a lot of people said that list was one of the reasons I won. Because, being a non-politician, where you don't have a record of choosing people, people just didn't know who I would choose.**

*And Supreme Court, especially for the Republican Party, it seems, was very, very important and I came up with the idea of a list of 20 and then I increased it to 25, 25 people and they're very outstanding people. I felt so badly that Justice Kavanaugh had to go through what he had to go through but now he's a Supreme Court justice and he's going to be a great one.**

*Justice Gorsuch went through much easier and he's going to be a great one.**

*And in that process you had to deal with a couple of Democratic senators: Kamala Harris, Dianne Feinstein. And the report is that you have agreed or the White House has agreed, your White House counsel, to giving Democrats a say in who gets to be on the Ninth Circuit. There's a Wall Street Journal editorial about this and so people like Erick Erickson have come out and have criticized this decision because they're saying you're basically giving up two seats on the Ninth Circuit when you're not renominating the people from before.**

*Well, I know nothing about it. That I can tell you. I would not do it. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do that. In fact, you can tell them for the first time, I will not do that. It's a false report. I've had many false reports from the Wall Street editorial board. Like, as an example, right now we're negotiating with China.**

*We're doing very well. Wall Street -- they don't like tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs they wouldn't even be talking to us. They would not even be talking to us. You understand that?**

*Well, on that issue, let me ask you about China. At the end of this, if there is not intellectual property protections in the deal, will you push the tariffs?**

*Well, what happens is that right now China's paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of goods. Mostly high technology. And I was going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion worth of goods and then I'd have $267 billion leftover where I'm not charging them anything. At their request, and subject to this deal until March 1st, I'm charging them 10 percent on 200 billion.**

*You've got the 50 and the 25, then you've got 200 and I'm charging them 10 percent until March 1st. After March 1st it will go up to 25 percent. So yeah, that's very important to me. You know, billions of dollars are being poured into our treasury. Billions. We never had five cents come into our treasury.**

*Now we have billions of dollars and in addition, and very importantly… The president returns to the issue of the Ninth Circuit court.**

*The Ninth Circuit is so much in one direction that you couldn't make that deal. Look, I've lost … the United States has lost so many cases in the Ninth Circuit and, you know, I had an argument -- a slight argument, which, I think was not too much of an argument -- with Justice Roberts about the Ninth Circuit.**

*If I did that, what are we doing? We have to catch up because we are so far behind on the Ninth Circuit. So I would never make that deal. And I can tell you, if it is made I would end it, but it wasn't, you know, not that I know of. No, the answer is: I would not do that. You don't catch up by making those deals.**

*Let me ask you about religious bigotry. I want to read a list to you first and then get your reaction because I think you're going to want to react to this. A number of high-profile Democrats have recently attacked people of faith for their religious beliefs.**

*Terrible.**

*You've got anti-Semitism in the leadership of the Women's March, sitting members of Congress who've expressed or condoned anti-Semitism, attacks on Second Lady Karen Pence for teaching at a Christian school, attacks by Democratic senators on your judicial nominees for being Catholic or members of the Knights of Columbus, attacks on the boys of Covington Catholic High School for being Catholic and Trump supporters.**

*Does the Democratic Party have a crisis of bigotry and how should they handle it?**

*I think it's a crisis for our country because there's never been a time -- I saw where today, I believe it was a congressman, took "in God we trust" --**

*"So help me God."**

*"So help me God." Took the phrase off of a document. And I said, "Where are we going?" I think it's a terrible thing for our country and I think it's certainly a terrible thing for the Democrats because I don't think they're going to be able to get away with it.**

*Another thing, sir, Virginia Govenor Northam actually right before this, suggested a mother who wants to have an abortion while in labor should instead be allowed to let her baby die after delivery if that's her choice. Do you think that would be infanticide?**

*I watched that this morning. I watched the person testifying and I felt it was terrible.**

*The Virginia delegate?**

*Yes. Do you remember during the debate I said Hillary Clinton was willing to rip the baby out of the womb just prior to birth? And I used the term "rip'? That's what it is. That's what they're doing, it's terrible.**

*Do you think this is an embrace by the Democrats of this type of abortion agenda?**

*I think this is going to lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it's never been lifted before. And the pro-life movement is very much a 50-50, it's a very 50-50 issue. Actually it's gained a point or two over the years, but it's been very much 49-51 and vice-versa. I think this really will lift up the issue because people have never thought of it in those terms.**

*Cause she actually said, you know, the day of, virtually the day of birth.**

*Northam suggested that today too.**

*Oh did he? So he confirmed that?**

*And he's a pediatric neurosurgeon.**

*I'm surprised that he did that. I've met him a number of times. I'm surprised that he said that. I saw the woman do it -- who ever that was, was that the attorney general?**

*She's a delegate. Kathy Tran, a delegate in Virginia.**

*So I was very, very surprised that they would say that and allow that.**

*Could you give us an exclusive preview of the State of the Union? What can we expect? Who are the guests that are going to be in the gallery?**

*Well, in fact, we're making up a list very shortly. But I will say that some of them will be border-related, some of them will be people who have suffered very badly because we didn't do what we should've done in a very dangerous part of our country, and so that's going to be a part of it, absolutely. At the same time, the world is not doing well and we're going great.**

*You look at the numbers, we're hitting highs. I get no credit for it. It's like, when do you ever hear them talking about -- we just hit 25,000 and you won't even hear a thing about it. If President Obama were there -- and don't forget, he was paying no interest. We're actually paying interest. You know, he was paying no interest.**

*He didn't have liquidity being drained out of the market in order to pay it down, which we have. How about 50 billion dollars a month? $50 billion a month. If I had a no interest, no liquidity situation with respect to the market, I mean, forget it. It would actually be incredible, the numbers. Big difference.**

*Tremendous difference.**

*The Super Bowl this weekend, I just want to get you on that because you're an NFL fan. I'm just going to stick to the Patriots here for a second. What makes Kraft, Brady, and Belichick so much better than everybody else and how are they always back in the big game?**

*So, it's talent, it's chemistry -- they have a great chemistry with each other -- I mean, I like all three of them, as you know, I'm very good friends with them. Coach Belichick endorsed me, you remember that? Belichick is so tough and Kraft is a great guy. The three of them they just have -- how good was Brady, I mean, the last game?**

*Not the last game, the last two games. Brady plays better under pressure than he does in a regular game. I mean, that last two minutes the way he was throwing the ball down the field -- they were bullets. And I've seen how hard that ball comes at you, those guys were doing a great job. They were catching that, you know?**

*That ball is whipped.**

*Have you noticed that all of the kneeling basically stopped this year and the ratings went up and the revenue went up? Is there any part of you that says, "Yeah, I won that fight'?**

*No, I don't want to take credit for that. You know I get along very well with the NFL. I helped them in Canada, you know that story where they were having a dispute for many years with Canada. And as part of NAFTA, you know, the termination of NAFTA and the new -- but as part of NAFTA, which is now the USMCA, I was able to get their dispute settled because they're a great American company and I don't want great American companies to have problems.**

*In fact, Commissioner Goodell called me and he thanked me, you know, they were working on that thing for years. It was having to do with the advertisements for the Super Bowl, it was a long-term problem and I got it solved. I think it's great what they did, it looks like it's straightened out. I think that may be famous last words, let's see what happens, but I think in the end it really worked out great.**

*And, you know what, their ratings went up along with -- as that problem went down, their ratings went up.**

*So you're satisfied with Goodell's performance? You don't think he should go?**

*No, I think -- look, I think that worked out very well. I was very pleased that he called me to thank me for helping him with Canada and yeah, it looks good. And their games have really been good other than one call. It was a little bit -- I feel badly, it was a great state that voted for me, Louisiana. I feel very badly for Louisiana because that was maybe the worst call I've ever seen but I guess there's nothing they can do about that.**

*And you might say it, I feel badly for Louisiana.**

*One final one on 2020 if you don't mind. Who is your dream candidate in 2020 to run against?**

*Well so far a lot of them. I don't mind. I think that there's a lot of talk about -- it looks like Elizabeth Warren has not caught on like they thought she would. She fell into a trap. It's called the Pocahontas trap. There's so many of them. The truth is there are some I'd love to run against.**

================================================================================

*Stephen Paddock, the shooter in Las Vegas in 2017. The FBI just closed its investigation yesterday without determining any motive. But don't you think Americans deserve to know why so many people died in the worst mass shooting in modern history?**

*It was a horrible event. He was a very, very sick person, obviously. It was very unusual in that there didn't seem to be your standard set of reasons as to why this would happen. I'm a little surprised that the report wasn't much longer but at the same time I can understand it. It was just a -- just a terrible thing.**

*They were unable to find a real reason other than, obviously, he was sick and they didn't know it. So, I was a little surprised and a lot disappointed that they weren't able to find the reason. Because you'd like to find a reason for that.**

*Were you following the developments through that case?**

*I was watching it like everybody else. I thought it was horrible. I went to the hospital, I saw many of the victims and right after the event it was horrible. It was inconceivable. But he was a very sick person and nobody would've known it. Nobody had any idea. He had money -- or at least they think he had money.**

*He was a gambler, you know, you don't see too many gamblers that have money. I think they worked very hard. I will tell you they worked very hard on that case. They just were unable to find anything from all of the facts. Because I've looked at some of the things also and it was a very unusual case of a very sick person who just, people never saw that coming.**

*Speaking of the FBI, sir, were you comfortable with the way and the force that was used against the raid in Roger Stone's house? Do you think that was appropriate for your FBI to be doing that in a white collar case?**

*I thought it was very unusual. You know, I've stayed out of that whole situation so that -- because there was no collusion whatsoever. There was no nothing done wrong and frankly, I could have waded in very early, I could have ended it very easily if I wanted to but just let it run its course. But I will say, like, I'm speaking for a lot of people that were very disappointed to see that go down that way, to see it happen where it was on camera, on top of it. That was a very, very disappointing scene --**

*You thought it was unusual that CNN was there?**

*— You have 29 people and you have armored vehicles and you had all of the other and, you know, many people know Roger, and Roger is not a person that they would have to worry about from that standpoint. I thought it was sad to see it.**

*Would you ask the FBI to review its use of force, its militarization when it handles cases like this?**

*I think it's a good question for you to ask, and it's something I'll think about.**

*One last question related to that. On the Paddock case, all of America was really interested to find out what happened there.**

*Including me.**

*Of course. And I wonder how many resources in the FBI were committed to the Paddock case versus committed to the Mueller investigation. How much money was spent? How many people were on those things? How do those two things compare?**

*What a great question that is. It's one of the better questions. I hope you're going to play your question because that is a very, very interesting -- you're talking about, I guess they're well over 30 million dollars now on this Russian collusion hoax, and everybody knows it's a hoax. They've spent all this money.**

*Nothing. No phone calls, no meetings, no nothing. You look at it, and you say, isn't that sad to have devoted this time, this energy over a -- you know, look, there's been numerous books written right now, including number one best sellers, calling it a "hoax." And it is very sad. That is very sad. By the way, to me, both very sad events.**

*But that is very interesting to ask, where you've had so many people killed, and so badly wounded, because I went to the hospital. You had people so badly wounded. People never talk about the wounded. The level of hurt and devastation for a whole lifetime. You know, many people just devastated for a lifetime.**

*They'll never be the same. And you look at that by comparison to the Russian hoax, it's a shame. The Russian witch hunt, it's a shame.**

*Speaking of that, sir, Matt Whitaker came out I think a couple of days ago. He said that the Mueller probe seems to be wrapping up, generally. Has he communicated that to you?**

*No. No, I haven't spoken to him about that. I would say that I think after almost two years it certainly should be. Process crimes or process, you know, questions, the answer is different than what you thought it might be and some people say they lost their memory or a lack of memory, which a lot of people can understand that too.**

*No, I never spoke to him about that.**

*So Whitaker or whoever is heading as the attorney general at the time will get to make a decision about releasing the report that Mueller sends him --**

*I don't know what --**

*Is that the kind of thing you'll sign off on if and when it comes to that decision?**

*They'll have to make their decision within the Justice Department. They will make the decision as to what they do. I could've taken a much different stance, I could've gotten involved in this, I could've terminated everything. I could've ended everything. I've chosen to stay out of it. But I had the right to, as you know, I had the right if I wanted to to end everything.**

*I could've just said, "that's enough." Many people thought that's what I should do.**

*You know, Andrew McCarthy has made the case that the reason Comey was recommended to be fired by Rod Rosenstein is that he went out in public and he made a public indictment of Hillary Clinton without actually recommending a prosecution. In other words, he made a character indictment of her in the court of public opinion.**

*In Andrew McCarthy's view, if this report comes out from Mueller and it does anything to try and go after you for any reason that doesn't have any criminality involved, that would be a disservice to you. That's not justice if the Justice Department is trying to say things to hurt your character but they don't have anything to do with criminality.**

*Well, I never had anything to do with the Russians having to do with this. I ran a great campaign. I ran a campaign that now they say was better than that gentleman's campaign in the 1800s and we did a great job. And we got 306 to 223 and that's that. Won states that nobody thought were possible to win. Remember the expression, "he cannot get to 270." And we got way beyond 270. And I don't even say she ran a bad campaign.**

*I think I ran a very good campaign.**

*Well the people who elected you are very interested in the immigration decision and what's going on with this negotiation. Republicans in charge of Congress for two years didn't get to your wall promise in Congress. How big of a roadblock to wall funding was Paul Ryan now that he's gone?**

*Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, "Please don't do that, we'll get you the wall." And I said, "I hope you mean that because I don't like this bill," although I love the bill for what it did for the military. And therefore, if it weren't for the military I would have vetoed it. Just so you understand, our military needed funding desperately.**

*Totally depleted. And this bill was great for the military. Had I vetoed it, you would never have gotten the numbers back that I got: $700 and $716 billion over the last two years. Which is substantially more -- much more than President Obama was able to get for the military. So that was a negative but a big factor as to why that was the reason I signed it. But another very big factor was the fact that Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, "please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall." Which is desperately needed by our country.**

*Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything -- people, criminals, gangs, so we need the wall. And then he went lame duck. And once he went lame duck it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone, so I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed.**

*And it is. And I'll get the wall.**

*Did he lie to you? Did he play you?**

*I don't want to say he lied. I think he probably meant it at the time, I guess. I hope. So I don't call that lying. But when he went lame duck, meaning, he said he's not running again -- and it was very unusual because usually they'll do that sometime after an election and he didn't want to do that because it's somewhat misrepresenting and I understand that too.**

*But maybe you don't run, okay? Maybe you just don't run. And he had an excellent person taking his place in Congress, he ran a great campaign, did a really good job. So Paul said, "please sign the omnibus bill." Now, in all fairness to Paul, I may have signed it anyway because it was so much more money than anyone ever thought possible for the military, and equal to the wall and maybe even greater than the wall was my promise to refurbish the military.**

*You know, I made many statements, many promises. In fact, here are some of them, folks. But those are some of the things we've accomplished. VA choice, VA accountability -- you know, these are things that for decades and decades and I got a lot of these things. Tax cuts, regulation cuts by far the most that anybody's ever got, biggest tax cuts.**

*And that's why you look at the market -- we just hit over 25,000. We're back where we were, right? So anyway, that's the story.**

*One thing that some conservatives are worried about is that you're prepared to give away some status for illegal immigrants in exchange for the things that you want. So when it comes to DACA, in these negotiations that are going on on Capitol Hill, how far are you willing to go there?**

*So I don't know if you saw -- you know, there was a couple of days ago, "he's going to give up DACA, he's going to —" First of all, it's not mine to give up right now because DACA is going to the Supreme Court, hopefully. But miraculously, and horribly, they lost DACA. This was a case that President Obama said, essentially, he doesn't have the right to sign.**

*But they went, as usual, to the Ninth Circuit and they won a case, they won an appeal, and now it's hopefully going to the Supreme Court soon because this is a very important case. We should win that case easily, you know, it should be won. Now, if it is won, then we'll talk about DACA but right now -- when that case was lost we were very close to making a deal.**

*And then a judge in the Ninth Circuit agreed that President Obama, although President Obama didn't think he had a right to do it, he said that -- as soon as that was done, I said, "that's the end of that deal." We had a deal for some DACA -- for a lot of things. But we had a deal done and I said to people when that case was lost -- well, it wasn't lost permanently, I think we're going to ultimately win -- that's the time I want to talk about it.**

*So DACA is tabled until the court resolves it?**

*Well I said to people, I saw yesterday, "well, what about DACA," I said, "it's highly unlikely." I was tougher than anybody else on that. I could see doing something for DACA but I want to find out what the Supreme Court's gonna do first.**

*Chuck Schumer said he doesn't want the White House playing a role in negotiations on Capitol Hill—**

*I don't blame him.**

*How much of a role are you going to play?**

*Because he doesn't want me to make the deal. He doesn't want to make me -- because my idea of a deal is different than other people's. Without our involvement a deal's not going to get done and I think we're going to -- look, that deal. Look, there are numerous things we could do, including declaring a national emergency where we have very good law on our side, including the fact that I'm already building a tremendous amount of wall.**

*People don't realize that. I'm going to be announcing the exact numbers but I'll have over a hundred miles of wall either built or under construction between new and renovated. Over a hundred miles. We have a tremendous amount of money right now to build a wall. We're building the wall. I'll be announcing some numbers on -- but in addition to that we declare a national emergency if this doesn't work out.**

*I believe you have a military base in Yuma, Arizona. Are you going to do some wall there? Is that the plan?**

*We have, I believe, that area -- yes. We have a tremendous problem in that area. It's very interesting, California, you know, they always say, "don't build a wall," well, they were begging me to build a wall over in San Diego. The day I finished they said, "don't build a wall." But they were begging me to build the wall because people were pouring in through that border, through that area.**

*We built a brand new wall. That's not a renovated wall, that's a brand new wall. We took down the old wall, we built a brand new wall. It's fantastic, looks great, they did a great job, totally stopped everybody from coming in. The day we completed it California started saying, "don't build a wall, we don't want a wall." They want drones, right?**

*Flying up around.**

*You talked about the courts, sir. Are you keeping an eye right now on Justice Ginsburg's health?**

*Well, look, I hope that she's healthy, I hope she's happy, and I hope she lives for a long time.**

*Would you commit to replacing her with somebody who was on that list -- somebody like Amy Barrett who a lot of conservatives have looked at?**

*Well I've been very religious. I've very much confined myself to that list, as you know. And that list has great people on it and I would say it's highly likely I would stay. I think one of the things --**

*But Amy Barrett would be a choice?**

*No, she would certainly be a choice. I think anybody on that list would be a choice. They're great people. I've been told, and I don't know that that's true, I would be surprised if it's true, but a lot of people said that list was one of the reasons I won. Because, being a non-politician, where you don't have a record of choosing people, people just didn't know who I would choose.**

I felt so badly that Justice Kavanaugh had to go through what he had to go through but now he's a Supreme Court justice and he's going to be a great one.**

Actually it's gained a point or two over the years, but it's been very much 49-51 and vice-versa. I think this really will lift up the issue because people have never thought of it in those terms.**

*Could you give us an exclusive preview of the State of the Union? What can we expect? Who are the guests that are going to be in the gallery?**

*Well, in fact, we're making up a list very shortly. But I will say that some of them will be border-related, some of them will be people who have suffered very badly because we didn't do what we should've done in a very dangerous part of our country, and so that's going to be a part of it, absolutely. At the same time, the world is not doing well and we're going great.**

*You look at the numbers, we're hitting highs. I get no credit for it. It's like, when do you ever hear them talking about -- we just hit 25,000 and you won't even hear a thing about it. If President Obama were there -- and don't forget, he was paying no interest. We're actually paying interest. You know, he was paying no interest.**

*He didn't have liquidity being drained out of the market in order to pay it down, which we have. How about 50 billion dollars a month? $50 billion a month. If I had a no interest, no liquidity situation with respect to the market, I mean, forget it. It would actually be incredible, the numbers. Big difference.**

*Tremendous difference.**

*The Super Bowl this weekend, I just want to get you on that because you're an NFL fan. I'm just going to stick to the Patriots here for a second. What makes Kraft, Brady, and Belichick so much better than everybody else and how are they always back in the big game?**

*So, it's talent, it's chemistry -- they have a great chemistry with each other -- I mean, I like all three of them, as you know, I'm very good friends with them. Coach Belichick endorsed me, you remember that? Belichick is so tough and Kraft is a great guy. The three of them they just have -- how good was Brady, I mean, the last game?**

*Not the last game, the last two games. Brady plays better under pressure than he does in a regular game. I mean, that last two minutes the way he was throwing the ball down the field -- they were bullets. And I've seen how hard that ball comes at you, those guys were doing a great job. They were catching that, you know?**

*That ball is whipped.**

*Have you noticed that all of the kneeling basically stopped this year and the ratings went up and the revenue went up? Is there any part of you that says, "Yeah, I won that fight'?**

*No, I don't want to take credit for that. You know I get along very well with the NFL. I helped them in Canada, you know that story where they were having a dispute for many years with Canada. And as part of NAFTA, you know, the termination of NAFTA and the new -- but as part of NAFTA, which is now the USMCA, I was able to get their dispute settled because they're a great American company and I don't want great American companies to have problems.**

*In fact, Commissioner Goodell called me and he thanked me, you know, they were working on that thing for years. It was having to do with the advertisements for the Super Bowl, it was a long-term problem and I got it solved. I think it's great what they did, it looks like it's straightened out. I think that may be famous last words, let's see what happens, but I think in the end it really worked out great.**

*And, you know what, their ratings went up along with -- as that problem went down, their ratings went up.**

*So you're satisfied with Goodell's performance? You don't think he should go?**

*No, I think -- look, I think that worked out very well. I was very pleased that he called me to thank me for helping him with Canada and yeah, it looks good. And their games have really been good other than one call. It was a little bit -- I feel badly, it was a great state that voted for me, Louisiana. I feel very badly for Louisiana because that was maybe the worst call I've ever seen but I guess there's nothing they can do about that.**

*And you might say it, I feel badly for Louisiana.**

*One final one on 2020 if you don't mind. Who is your dream candidate in 2020 to run against?**

*Well so far a lot of them. I don't mind. I think that there's a lot of talk about -- it looks like Elizabeth Warren has not caught on like they thought she would. She fell into a trap. It's called the Pocahontas trap. There's so many of them. The truth is there are some I'd love to run against.**

*Thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and re-open the federal government. [Applause] As everyone knows, I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn’t want to use it at this time. Hopefully it will be unnecessary. I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers, and their amazing families, who have shown such extraordinary devotion in the face of this recent hardship.**

*You are fantastic people. You are incredible patriots. Many of you have suffered far greater than anyone, but your families would know or understand. And not only did you not complain, but in many cases you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security.**

*Again, I thank you. All Americans, I thank you. You are very, very special people. I am so proud that you are citizens of our country. When I say "Make America Great Again," it could never be done without you. Great people. In a short while, I will sign a bill to open our government for three weeks until February 15th. I will make sure that all employees receive their back pay very quickly, or as soon as possible.**

*It'll happen fast. I am asking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put this proposal on the floor immediately. After 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue, I have seen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside -- I think -- and put the security of the American people first.**

*I do believe they're going to do that. They have said they are for complete border security, and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having barriers, fencing, or walls -- or whatever you want to call it -- will be an important part of the solution. A bipartisan Conference Committee of House and Senate lawmakers and leaders will immediately begin reviewing the requests of our Homeland Security experts -- and experts they are -- and also law enforcement professionals, who have worked with us so closely.**

*We want to thank Border Patrol, ICE, and all law enforcement. Been incredible. [Applause] Based on operational guidance from the experts in the field, they will put together a Homeland Security package for me to shortly sign into law. Over the next 21 days, I expect that both Democrats and Republicans will operate in good faith.**

*This is an opportunity for all parties to work together for the benefit of our whole beautiful, wonderful nation. If we make a fair deal, the American people will be proud of their government for proving that we can put country before party. We can show all Americans, and people all around the world, that both political parties are united when it comes to protecting our country and protecting our people.**

*Many disagree, but I really feel that, working with Democrats and Republicans, we can make a truly great and secure deal happen for everyone. Walls should not be controversial. Our country has built 654 miles of barrier over the last 15 years, and every career Border Patrol agent I have spoken with has told me that walls work.**

*They do work. No matter where you go, they work. Israel built a wall -- 99.9 percent successful. Won't be any different for us. They keep criminals out. They save good people from attempting a very dangerous journey from other countries -- thousands of miles -- because they think they have a glimmer of hope of coming through.**

*With a wall, they don’t have that hope. They keep drugs out, and they dramatically increase efficiency by allowing us to patrol far larger areas with far fewer people. It’s just common sense. Walls work. That’s why most of the Democrats in Congress have voted in the past for bills that include walls and physical barriers and very powerful fences.**

*The walls we are building are not medieval walls. They are smart walls designed to meet the needs of frontline border agents, and are operationally effective. These barriers are made of steel, have see-through visibility, which is very important, and are equipped with sensors, monitors, and cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art drones.**

*We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea -- we never did; we never proposed that; we never wanted that -- because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They're already there. They've been there for millions of years. Our proposed structures will be in pre-determined high-risk locations that have been specifically identified by the Border Patrol to stop illicit flows of people and drugs.**

*No border security plan can ever work without a physical barrier. Just doesn’t happen. At the same time, we need to increase drug detection technology and manpower to modernize our ports of entry, which are obsolete. The equipment is obsolete. They're old. They're tired. This is something we have all come to agree on, and will allow for quicker and safer commerce.**

*These critical investments will improve and facilitate legal trade and travel through our lawful ports of entry. Our plan also includes desperately needed humanitarian assistance for those being exploited and abused by coyotes, smugglers, and the dangerous journey north. The requests we have put before Congress are vital to ending the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border.**

*Absolutely vital. Will not work without it. This crisis threatens the safety of our country and thousands of American lives. Criminal cartels, narco-terrorists, transnational gangs like MS-13, and human traffickers are brazenly violating U.S. laws and terrorizing innocent communities. Human traffickers -- the victims are women and children.**

*Maybe to a lesser extent, believe or not, children. Women are tied up. They're bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks. They don’t go through your port of entry. They make a right turn going very quickly.**

*They go into the desert areas, or whatever areas you can look at. And as soon as there's no protection, they make a left or a right into the United States of America. There's nobody to catch them. There's nobody to find them. They can't come through the port, because if they come through the port, people will see four women sitting in a van with tape around their face and around their mouth.**

*Can't have that. And that problem, because of the Internet, is the biggest problem -- it's never been like this before -- that you can imagine. It's at the worst level -- human trafficking -- in the history of the world. This is not a United States problem; this is a world problem. But they come through areas where they have no protection, where they have no steel barriers, where they have no walls.**

*And we can stop almost 100 percent of that. The profits reaped by these murderous organizations are used to fund their malign and destabilizing conduct throughout this hemisphere. Last year alone, ICE officers removed 10,000 known or suspected gang members, like MS-13 and members as bad as them. Horrible people.**

*Tough. Mean. Sadistic. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested a total of 266,000 criminal aliens inside of the United States, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 homicides or, as you would call them, violent, vicious killings. It can be stopped.**

*Vast quantities of lethal drugs -- including meth, fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine -- are smuggled across our southern border and into U.S. schools and communities. Drugs kill much more than 70,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. The sheer volume of illegal immigration has overwhelmed federal authorities and stretched our immigration system beyond the breaking point.**

*Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for medical assistance -- they are very, very sick -- making this a health crisis as well. It's a very big health crisis. People have no idea how big it is, unless you're there. Our backlog in the immigration courts is now far greater than the 800,000 cases that you've been hearing about over the last couple of years.**

*Think of that, though: 800,000 cases because our laws are obsolete. So obsolete. They're the laughing stock all over the world. Our immigration laws, all over the world -- they’ve been there for a long time -- are the laughing stock, all over the world. We do not have the necessary space or resources to detain, house, vet, screen, and safely process this tremendous influx of people.**

*In short, we do not have control over who is entering our country, where they come from, who they are, or why they are coming. The result, for many years, is a colossal danger to public safety. We're going to straighten it out. It's not hard. It's easy, if given the resources. Last month was the third straight month in a row with 60,000 apprehensions on our southern border.**

*Think of that. we apprehended 60,000 people. That's like a stadium full of people. A big stadium. There are many criminals being apprehended, but vast numbers are coming because our economy is so strong. We have the strongest economy now in the entire world. You see what's happening. We have nowhere left to house them and no way to promptly remove them.**

*We can't get them out because our laws are so obsolete, so antiquated, and so bad. Without new resources from Congress, we will be forced to release these people into communities -- something we don’t want to do -- called catch-and-release. You catch them. Even if they are criminals, you then release them.**

*And you can't release them from where they came, so they go into our country and end up in places you would least suspect. And we do as little releasing as possible, by they're coming by the hundreds of thousands. I have had zero Democrat lawmakers volunteer to have them released into their districts or states.**

*And I think they know that, and that's what we're going to be discussing over the next three weeks. The painful reality is that the tremendous economic and financial burdens of illegal immigration fall on the shoulders of low-income Americans, including millions of wonderful, patriotic, law-abiding immigrants who enrich our nation.**

*As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the defense of our great country. We cannot surrender operational control over the nation’s borders to foreign cartels, traffickers, and smugglers. We want future Americans to come to our country legally and through a system based on merit. We need people to come to our country.**

*We have great companies moving back into the United States. And we have the lowest employment and the best employment numbers that we've ever had. There are more people working today in the United States than have ever worked in our country. We need people to come in to help us -- the farms, and with all of these great companies that are moving back.**

*Finally, they're moving back. People said it couldn’t happen. It's happening. And we want them to enjoy the blessings of safety and liberty, and the rule of law. We cannot protect and deliver these blessings without a strong and secure border. I believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border.**

*I believe drugs, large percentages of which come through the southern border, will be cut by a number that nobody will believe. So let me be very clear: We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15th, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.**

*We will have great security. And I want to thank you all very much. Thank you very much. [Applause]**

*Well, thank you very much. We have some of the most respected -- and powerful, frankly -- they have tremendous congregations of pastors and ministers anywhere in this country. And they've been talking to me for a long period of time. And you probably saw we went up 19 percent -- I saw that just a little while -- with the Hispanic population.**

*Part of it is the jobs because they're doing record-setting jobs right now. But part of it is what we talk about -- the wall and security. And these are just tremendous people. Many have been my friends for a long period of time. And I thought we'd go around the table and say a few words. And that would be great.**

*We'll start with -- Pastor, please.**

*Sure. Mr. President, thank you for having us here today. I have a letter to present to you from 150 Hispanic evangelical leaders, simply saying an expression of gratitude for your good-faith efforts to work with Democrats and try to get everyone to the table to get things moving again. You've done a very good job and been the leader we need you to be in extending a hand to them to come to the table.**

*And we want to say thank you for doing that, and we want to say thank you for doing everything you can to get aid, in a humanitarian way, for this crisis where it's needed most, securing our borders, and providing for law enforcement and the Border Patrol everything they need -- all the tools and resources that are needed.**

*One thing you have not done, Mr. President, is manufacture a humanitarian crisis. It's real. And although many people began to declare repeatedly this is a manufactured crisis -- being a pastor from Texas, I can tell you the human suffering that's been going on for many decades has hit a fever pitch. And I'm grateful that you have shown leadership to recognize it, to call it out, and to actually do something about it. So thank you, sir, for doing that.**

*Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please.**

*Mr. President, I'm Norma from the International Church of Las Vegas. I'm a pastor there in the -- not only in the large community but in the Latino community. And about a week ago, I heard a briefing that you were doing where you were talking about border security and also the humanitarian crisis. And I literally just -- as I was listening to you share that, I pulled over to the side and I just started praying.**

*And I was like, do the American people hear the statistics that the President is saying? Do the American people know what our reality is? So in that moment, I feel like I had like a truth encounter with what you were saying, and I started praying, "Lord, let America have this truth encounter." I am an immigrant from Mexico and also daughter of an immigrant from Mexico, and I just wanted you to know that you have not only my support but you have the support of our community.**

*Yes, there's things that we need to resolve. I feel like you do an amazing job resolving not only the need for security, but this crisis that has been going on for many -- many years with the security of our nation and also with immigration issues that have been going on for so many years. So I just wanted to thank you and wanted you to know that you have our support.**

*We'll get it done.**

*Absolutely.**

*We'll get it done.**

*I'm Pastor Guillermo Maldonado from King Jesus Ministry in Miami. And we're here to support you, Mr. President. You know, there's misconception in the public, thinking that Spanish community is for illegal immigration. There's a misconception also that we want open borders. And dealing with people every single day, I see that our community support what you're doing.**

*We don’t want open borders. I've been in 70 countries, preaching the Gospel, and every country has laws and order. And every country we go, America has been so gracious, opening the doors and opening the doors for every person that comes. And that misconception that Spanish people want open borders, they want no laws, that's not true.**

*We're here to support you, and what you're doing is great. The lowest unemployment for Spanish people -- 4 percent -- that's incredible.**

*Yeah. In history. That's in history.**

*And that's why you have seen an increase of your support -- the support of the Spanish people to you. So we greatly appreciate it.**

*Thank you, Pastor.**

*We pray for you. And we want you to know you can count with our support.**

*Thank you, Pastor. I appreciate it. Thank you. Please.**

*Mr. President Trump, thank you so much for all you're doing for America. I'm Pastor Pasqual from the International Church of Las Vegas. And I support wholly what you're doing here -- what you're doing for America, concerning the crisis there at the border. I'm involved a lot with human trafficking and gang violence with the police department in Las Vegas, and we know there's a crisis.**

*And we want to tell you thank you for everything that you're doing, and we support all that you're doing.**

*And the gangs comes from south of the border, right?**

*Yes. Gang --**

*Almost everybody?**

*Yes.**

*Almost all of them?**

*Most of them that come to Las Vegas, they're trying to fit in somewhere, work things out, and they can't get anything going, so they start joining groups -- the gangs. And that's how that happens. And we -- I work alongside the police department. We have our churches that are connected to the police department in different city -- in different areas of the city.**

*And when there's a crime or violence, we go out with them and we hit the ground with the police department there to restore order back in certain areas.**

*Right. Great job you do. Fantastic job. Pastor?**

*Hi. I am Pastor Marilyn Rivera, and I am the first lady president of the Hispanic Pastors Association in South Florida. And I just want to tell you that we pray for you, we are behind you, and we want safe borders.**

*Thank you.**

*And where we need to sit with you for immigration reform, whatever, let's work together.**

*Good. Well, thank you. And you've been fantastic. Mike? Mike Pence.**

*Just, it's an honor to welcome these wonderful Hispanic pastors here. We're grateful for their ministries, and we're grateful for your prayers. And the support that you have shown the President; record unemployment for Hispanic Americans, African Americans across the country; and the leadership that you've expressed support for; the President has brought to our nation's engagement in this hemisphere means a great deal to all of us. But thank you all for being here.**

*And a big part of it is the economy is so strong that people are -- they're rushing our borders.**

*Well, thank you for a strong economy, but also you're our Commander-in-Chief, and part of these issues is the safety of our country. Our country changed after 9/11 and we're dealing with issues that we didn’t have to perhaps deal with in the past. But I want to specifically say that, as a woman and a pastor, I deal with victims of human trafficking, which is at an all-time high.**

*And a strong America -- when it comes to security and defending women and children, and even some men are trafficked, as well, against their will. The horrific violence and even death of thousands of people across our border is something that no one has addressed. And I'm very grateful for this. And I'm also grateful that we're here at the table and that we have this dialogue and that you're open to it. I thank you for that.**

*And I know you have a compassion for women, for children, for families. So, for that, I am very grateful and very hopeful of the future, Mr. President.**

*Good. We're going to have a great future. Thank you very much. Secretary Nielsen?**

*I just want to thank everyone for being here. I want to thank you all for your leadership and your compassion for taking such good care of your communities and for working with the Department of Homeland Security. We'd love to continue to strengthen our partnership, to learn from you, to understand what's happening within our communities so that we can, together, make them safer under the President's leadership.**

*So thank you for being here. It's very important. Thank you.**

*She's got a very easy job. [Laughter] Reverend?**

*Hello. Mr. President, thank you for having me here. My name is Mario Sandoval. I'm a pastor in Waco, Texas, a Hispanic community. And we -- there, where I'm at, we suffer, we see what the people actually go through. And we're not for open borders. We're for secure borders, because we know that it's going to bring resolution to a lot of the things that people go through.**

*And so we're here to support you for that.**

*Thank you, Reverend. Appreciate it. Pastor?**

*Thank you very much. My name is Mario Bramnick, a pastor with New Wine Ministries and president of the Latino Coalition for Israel. We're really amazed by your leadership. What President Trump promises, President Trump delivered -- from the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem, to the appointments of incredible Supreme Court justices, and now to what you're doing for border security.**

*As Hispanics with the soar in the poll numbers, you can see that we do want strong border security that you stand for. And from the times I've had the honor to meet you, I know you have a compassion for the Hispanic people. And it's true, from your heart, all the times that we were able to be with you, and as evidenced by the historic unemployment rate, as evidenced by your willingness to help with DACA and TPS relief.**

*And we're with you. We're praying for you. And it's an honor to be here with you.**

*Thank you very much, Pastor. Beautifully said. Lourdes?**

*Mr. President, as president of Eres America, my task is to bring leadership of the nation as we have sitting here today. I work with every organization and denominations that are in the leadership with the Hispanics. One of the things that I see and resonates today is the fact that there's a great misconception.**

*The media gives a major misconception of the Hispanic community and the support that we have for you. I can emphatically say your values stand aligned to the Hispanic community. And that is -- what you have seen in the polls is that they have seen, no matter what the media says, they see that your actions speak aligned to their heart's desire.**

*And so they've got it all wrong. They're making my task more interesting, yet the message is getting to our Hispanic community --**

*I think it is.**

*-- from truck drivers in Los Angeles. You've got the Villareal names following you. The Gonzaleses. You've got Hispanics that truly supporting. And this reality that we've had -- back to President Calderon in Mexico dealing with the human trafficking -- was appalling; the catastrophes that we saw. We worked hand in hand and we were never able to achieve what you've already brought to the table.**

*For that, the Hispanic community and America says thank you.**

*Well, thank you, Lourdes. And I will say we've made a lot of progress. And when we're given the right ingredients -- and we need that; we need the wall and we need other things; we need other forms of technology -- you'll see numbers that are even better. We've done a lot of work -- a lot of great work. And I will say, the numbers will get even better once we have the right things, including technology, by the way.**

*But if we don’t have that wall, and if we don’t have a very powerful barrier, it's all just a waste of time. It can't work. Can't work. So we'll get it. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.**

*[Inaudible] get a deal?**

*I think we have a chance, yeah. I think we have a good chance. We're going to work with the Democrats. We're going to see. And if we can't do that, then we'll do -- obviously we're going to do the emergency, because that's what it is. It's a national emergency. These are Hispanic pastors and reverends and ministers, and they understand better than anybody, it's an emergency.**

*It's a humanitarian emergency. And we are going to take care of our border. It's going to be done. And crime is going to go down throughout our whole country, not just at the border. The border is the least of it. It's what comes in through the border and permeates throughout the whole country. And you're going to see drugs drop way down, because a big percentage come in through the border.**

*You will see drugs way down. You're going to see crime go way down. So we're going to do it, and we're doing well. And I really appreciate you being here. Thank you. Thank you all very much.**

*Well, thank you very much. We have some of the most respected -- and powerful, frankly -- they have tremendous congregations of pastors and ministers anywhere in this country. And they've been talking to me for a long period of time. And you probably saw we went up 19 percent -- I saw that just a little while -- with the Hispanic population.**

*Part of it is the jobs because they're doing record-setting jobs right now. But part of it is what we talk about -- the wall and security. And these are just tremendous people. Many have been my friends for a long period of time. And I thought we'd go around the table and say a few words. And that would be great.**

*We'll start with -- Pastor, please.**

*Sure. Mr. President, thank you for having us here today. I have a letter to present to you from 150 Hispanic evangelical leaders, simply saying an expression of gratitude for your good-faith efforts to work with Democrats and try to get everyone to the table to get things moving again. You've done a very good job and been the leader we need you to be in extending a hand to them to come to the table.**

*And we want to say thank you for doing that, and we want to say thank you for doing everything you can to get aid, in a humanitarian way, for this crisis where it's needed most, securing our borders, and providing for law enforcement and the Border Patrol everything they need -- all the tools and resources that are needed.**

*One thing you have not done, Mr. President, is manufacture a humanitarian crisis. It's real. And although many people began to declare repeatedly this is a manufactured crisis -- being a pastor from Texas, I can tell you the human suffering that's been going on for many decades has hit a fever pitch. And I'm grateful that you have shown leadership to recognize it, to call it out, and to actually do something about it. So thank you, sir, for doing that.**

*Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please.**

*Mr. President, I'm Norma from the International Church of Las Vegas. I'm a pastor there in the -- not only in the large community but in the Latino community. And about a week ago, I heard a briefing that you were doing where you were talking about border security and also the humanitarian crisis. And I literally just -- as I was listening to you share that, I pulled over to the side and I just started praying.**

*And I was like, do the American people hear the statistics that the President is saying? Do the American people know what our reality is? So in that moment, I feel like I had like a truth encounter with what you were saying, and I started praying, "Lord, let America have this truth encounter." I am an immigrant from Mexico and also daughter of an immigrant from Mexico, and I just wanted you to know that you have not only my support but you have the support of our community.**

*Yes, there's things that we need to resolve. I feel like you do an amazing job resolving not only the need for security, but this crisis that has been going on for many -- many years with the security of our nation and also with immigration issues that have been going on for so many years. So I just wanted to thank you and wanted you to know that you have our support.**

*We'll get it done.**

*Absolutely.**

*We'll get it done.**

*I'm Pastor Guillermo Maldonado from King Jesus Ministry in Miami. And we're here to support you, Mr. President. You know, there's misconception in the public, thinking that Spanish community is for illegal immigration. There's a misconception also that we want open borders. And dealing with people every single day, I see that our community support what you're doing.**

*We don’t want open borders. I've been in 70 countries, preaching the Gospel, and every country has laws and order. And every country we go, America has been so gracious, opening the doors and opening the doors for every person that comes. And that misconception that Spanish people want open borders, they want no laws, that's not true.**

*Another day in paradise, right? [Laughter] A good day. A good day. This is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act that this room is very enthused about, that a lot of people are very enthused about. We're taken advantage of by many, many countries all over the world. They charge us tariffs and taxe -- the likes of which nobody has any understanding, they're so high and so unfair.**

*They also have barriers where we can't go in. They have trade barriers that make it impossible for us to sell our farm products and our other products or cars in those places. So this is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, and it's really a preliminary meeting. It's a little bit of an early meeting. We're going to be talking about it. We have tremendous support, and we're going to find out what happens.**

*It should have been done many years ago, as many things should have been done many years ago. Frankly, the wall should have been built many years ago; we wouldn't have the problems that we have today. So I'm pleased to welcome Republican members of Congress to the White House. I especially want to thank Congressman Sean Duffy for sponsoring one of the top legislative priorities, to my way of thinking, that you can have.**

*It's called "fairness," really. The United States Reciprocal Trade Act -- this legislation will help finally to give our workers a fair and level playing field against other countries. Countries are taking advantage of us, whether they think we're very nice or not so smart. They've been doing it for many, many years, and we want to end it. Many of these are friends.**

*Many of these are allies. But sometimes allies take advantage of us even more so than our non-allies. All over the world, foreign countries put massive tariffs on our products while we put very few, if any, on theirs. So we then wonder why we're not doing the business we should be doing. And we wonder, maybe most importantly, why we had, last year, over an $800 trillion trade deficient -- $800 billion, in terms of a trade deficit.**

*So when you have a number like $800 billion, you say to yourself, "Somebody made a lot of bad deals." And that's happened over a long period of time. The Reciprocal Trade Act will give us the tools to solve this problem once and for all. In addition to the various trade deals that we're working on with Mexico, Canada, China -- South Korea, we just finished.**

*It's a good deal. Made it a good deal. It was a terrible deal, and we made it into a good deal. We'll get the trade way down and we'll get the deficits way down. Under the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act, whatever the tariffs for a foreign country is, we place the same tariff on us. So if somebody is charging -- and I brought a chart.**

*If somebody is charging us 100 percent tariff, and we're charging them nothing, we're entitled to charge the same tariff as them. And what's going to happen, I think, from a practical standpoint, is they won't be charging us tariffs anymore. We'll see. Or we'll charge them a lot. It's a tremendous amount of money.**

*It's a tremendous problem for our country. The U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act will be an incredible tool to bring foreign countries to the negotiating table and to get them to lower their tariffs on our products and also to get rid of their trade barriers, making it really impossible for us to do business. India, as an example, has a 150 percent -- hard to believe -- tariff on whiskey.**

*They make whiskey, and they sell it to us. We charge them zero. We sell it to them; they charge us 150 percent. So I would say, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Okay? [Laughter] That's the least of it. We have far worse than that. The EU charges us 67 percent tariff on pork, and we charge them almost nothing.**

*And they make it very hard for us to sell pork in the EU. For bulldozers, Malaysia charges us, as an example, 20 percent, and Indonesia charges us a lot. We charge them all nothing. We charge them nothing. Very unfair to our companies. Very unfair to our workers. So if countries refuse to lower their barriers, then we will simply place a matching tariff on their product.**

*It's very simple. It's the simplest thing that you can do. The result will be more countries will remove their barriers and open their markets to American exports, to American farmers, to American manufacturers. I will be talking a lot about reciprocal trade over the next six years. Hopefully, we'll have it done in two years or less.**

*And we will see deficits down to a level that would really -- you know, we talk about "Make America Great Again"; we have to do these things to make America great again. Because we can't lose almost $800 billion on trade, like has been done for many years. And it's been numbers -- they varied anywhere from $300 billion to over $800 billion.**

*Can't do that. And what we're doing with China, I think, will have a tremendous impact, if you look at the numbers that we're talking about. We'll see how that all comes out. But, as you know, we're charging tremendous tariffs now, and they go up, as of March 1st, very substantially. I think China would like to make a deal.**

*We'd like to make a deal. I like exactly where we are right now, to be honest with you. We're very happy. We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury -- billions -- from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in. But if we could make a deal that'll be great -- on intellectual property, and theft, and all of the other things we're talking about, in addition to taxes themselves.**

*So I'll be talking a lot about this over the next period of time, and I want to just thank the incredible people -- all friends of mine. They are -- this is a very early meeting. This is the beginning of something, I think, that's going to be very important for our country. And I look forward to discussing it. They did a chart, right here, where, as an example, these are -- and these are not big abuses.**

*You look at apples. Japan, foreign tariff -- 17 percent. The United States -- nothing. We get nothing; they get 17. The same apple. Actually, ours are better, you want to know the truth. [Laughter] So that makes it even worse. I don't want to cover you up. You're such a good-looking guy,**

*No, you're good. You're good.**

*He's a handsome man. I don't want to cover him up. Autos, China -- you have a 15 percent tariff, and the U.S. has 2.5. So when you sell -- and, by the way, we got the autos down from 40 in China. I got them down to 15. But it's still 15 percent versus 2.5 percent. But, if you know, it was 40 and 25 percent.**

*We got them down to 15, but that's really not good enough because we have 15 versus 2.5 percent. And we don't even get the 2.5 percent. There are ways that they can eliminate that. French fries -- one of our favorite meals. [Laughter] French fries from Thailand -- 30 percent. We get 8 percent. You look at the numbers.**

*Go down -- look at motorcycles, as an example. India -- 50 percent. It was 100 percent. I got them down to 50 percent just by talking for about two minutes. But it's still 50 percent versus 2.4 percent. Again, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Pork, EU -- pretty much zero. And it's 67 percent. So you look at that, and something like whiskey from India, and other things from India -- India is a very high tariff.**

*They charge us a lot of tariffs. But you look at whiskey. So India gets 150 percent, and we get nothing. I will tell you that those are just a few of the products. It's actually much worse than that, as bad as that sounds. And all we're saying -- if you're going to charge us 150 percent, we're going to charge you 150 percent.**

*And what will happen, in many cases, is we'll both charge each other nothing or we'll get 150 percent. That's okay, too. I spoke to a couple senators about this that are really into this stuff, and they said, "Hey, sounds fair to me." And a lot of people think it's fair. We have to get foreign countries to respect us again, both militarily and on trade.**

*And I tell you, we have come a long way in two years. It's a whole different ballgame. When you look at what's happened, it's a whole different ballgame. So this is the Reciprocal Trade Act, and I think that it's something that's going to -- you're going to hear a lot about it. And, you know, hard to believe -- you'll have people that are against it. You'll have people say that we don't mind if a country charges us 50 percent, 100 percent, 250 percent.**

*We have some cases, like with butter -- Sean was telling me -- in Wisconsin. Do you want to tell that story? The difference?**

*Yeah, so Europe charges us 68 percent tariffs on our Wisconsin butter, and we charge 2.8 percent on European butter. It's totally unfair. It's not right.**

*Mister great hockey player, congratulations on your victory. We worked hard, right?**

*Thank you, Mr. President.**

*That was a great job. Great job. Thank you.**

*We appreciate your support.**

*[Inaudible] Thank you very much. Congratulations. So thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.**

*[Inaudible] with this idea of the temporary spending measure to reopen the government, allow federal workers to --**

*Well, one of the ideas suggested is they open it, they pay a -- sort of a prorated down payment for the wall, which I think people agree that you need. You need the wall. In fact, I see a lot of the Democrats are all -- almost all of them are breaking and saying, "Look, walls are good. Walls are good." Big difference from what you had two or three weeks ago.**

*And the vote -- we had the vote on our bill, which we won 50-47. That was our bill. But we got one Democrat. It was 50-47. And we need -- as you know, we have to get 60. We don't have 60 votes, so we need Democrat support. We didn't get Democrat support, other than from a -- actually, a wonderful man, as you know -- Senator Manchin.**

*And he's doing the right thing for his people. I mean, he's doing the right thing for West Virginia, frankly. And the other bill -- it was 52-44. And that included a lot of hurricane relief for a lot of different states. So it's sort of not something -- some of them really voted for the hurricane relief, which they felt they needed.**

*That was 52-44. But you need 60. So that didn't go anywhere. So we knew they both were not going to go anywhere, we thought. And now Mitch is negotiating with Chuck Schumer, and we'll see what happens. I think they just left a meeting. They just had a meeting. I think they're going to have to see their people.**

*But they just left. So we have two bills. I think we did very well. The Republicans held. Except for two, the Republicans held. Two were not there. They couldn't -- they weren't able to be there, so there were two non-votes. But even with two non-votes, I think they would have been good votes for us. It's 50-47; we won.**

*But we need 60 votes because of the 60-vote rule. And so I just really want to thank the Republicans for holding. Again, on the other one, that was the opening up. That's 52-44, but you need 60 votes. So it's a long way short. And a lot of that -- a lot of those votes were based on the fact that there was hurricane relief for certain states.**

*[Inaudible] temporary spending without money for the wall, which is just to reopen the government --**

*Well, I wouldn't be happy with it. I wouldn't be happy. But we have a lot of alternatives. Honestly, we have -- everybody -- look, for the most part, people agree -- when I say "everybody," I would say almost everybody agrees we have to have border security. We have to have a wall in order to have border security.**

*You cannot have border security without a wall. I mean, we can play games, and we can talk about technology. We can talk about drones flying around. You know, right now, formed, is an 8,000-person caravan. And the caravan is heading our way. Congratulations. We have another one. We stopped the first one.**

*We stopped the second one. I wouldn't say that Tijuana is too happy, but they're happily living in Tijuana right now. And a lot of them have gone back. But we stopped them, but it's very tough. And if we didn't have a wall in those areas, it would have been very hard to stop them. We have the military and we have the Border Patrol; they've done an incredible job.**

*And ICE has done an incredible job all over the country, frankly. We've removed thousands of MS-13 and others out of our country. But if we had a wall, we wouldn't have that problem. It would be great. So we have a lot of alternatives, but I'm just honored that almost all of the Republicans voted for our bill.**

*Our bill is the bill that, I think, we're really focused on. But we had almost all of the Republicans, so the end result was 50-47. The Democrats lost one that came over to our side. So they pretty much held, and we held. And, again, we were missing two Republicans. They couldn't vote. They were not here.**

*Do you get the sense that there's enough movement to end the shutdown soon? Or are we going to see this drag out for a while?**

*Well, I have to find out. After this meeting, we'll find out. But right now, Mitch McConnell is meeting with Chuck Schumer and to see -- they'll have to see what happens. They're meeting to see if they can work out something, maybe on a temporary basis where we start. But I have -- you know, we have a lot of alternatives.**

*There are a lot of people that want this to happen. I'll tell you who wants this to happen: The military wants this to happen because this is a virtual invasion of our country -- of drugs, of human traffickers, of so many different things, of criminals. It's an invasion of our country. And the military wants this to happen, and the Border Patrol wants this to happen.**

*And, by the way, Border Patrol said all of the drones flying up in the air -- having a lot of fun, flying drones all over the place -- they don't mean a thing when they look down and they see thousands of people rushing our border. The only thing that works is a strong barrier or wall.**

*Have you talked to Nancy Pelosi? Or do you plan to talk to her soon?**

*I have not. I haven't spoken to Nancy Pelosi. But I'm here, you know? I haven't left except for a beautiful evening in Iraq. I've been here for a long time.**

*Mr. President, did you see Wilbur Ross said that he didn't understand why federal workers would need help getting food? Can you understand why?**

*No, I haven't -- I haven't heard the statement, but I do understand that perhaps he should have said it differently. Local people know who they are when they go for groceries and everything else. And I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is that they will work along. I know banks are working along.**

*If you have mortgages, the mortgagees -- the mortgage -- the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that's what happens in times like this. They know the people. They've been dealing with them for years. And they work along. The grocery store -- and I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant, but I haven't seen his statement, no. But he's done a great job, I will tell you that.**

*Yes.**

*On Venezuela, I just want to know: Aren't you worried to leave the American diplomats behind?**

*Well, we're looking at Venezuela. It's a very sad situation. That was the richest state in all of that area. That's a big, beautiful area, and by far the richest. And now it's one of the poorest places in the world. That's what socialism gets you, when they want to raise your taxes to 70 percent. You know, it's interesting, I've been watching our opponents -- our future opponents -- talking about 70 percent.**

*Number one, they can't do it for 70 percent. It's got to be probably twice that number. But, maybe more importantly, what happens is you really have to study and take a look at what's happened to Venezuela. It is a very, very sad situation. So we have our eye very closely on Venezuela. Very closely.**

*Mr. President, if Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer can come to some sort of agreement, will you support the results of those negotiations?**

*Well, it depends what the agreement is. I mean, yeah -- but if they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it. Yeah.**

*Even if it has no wall money? Or does it have to have wall money?**

*I only -- look, look -- I have other alternatives, if I have to. And I'll use those alternatives if I have to. But we want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country. We have criminals pouring into our country. And I'm not talking about the southern border. They don't stay there. They go through and they permeate all throughout the country, including places like Wisconsin -- a lot of different places.**

*And that's the problem. I say that we would cut our crime -- you know, we're very well on crime rate, compared to past years and past administration, but I think our crime rate would go way down. And I know our drug rates -- our drug -- what's happening is the drugs are pouring in. And, yes, they come through the ports of entry, but the big trucks come through areas where you don't have a wall and you have wide-open spaces.**

*We have to have the wall. You'd stop drugs. You'd stop human trafficking. I mean, human trafficking -- where they tie up women and they put duct tape on their mouths, and they put them in the backseat of a car or in a van. They don't come through a port of entry because the people at the port of entry are going to see that.**

*That's not like hiding drugs in the engine or in the hubcaps, and they have incredible, ingenious ideas. I mean, frankly, I have to say, some of these people are so genius, if they were ever legit, they'd become very rich people. But what they do is they go through the ports of entry with small stuff, but the big stuff comes through areas where you have nobody watching.**

*I mean, you have hundreds of miles of open space, and they go out there, and they're loaded up with drugs or they have women in the backseat of the cars with duct tape all over the place. It's a disgrace. And you don't catch them. They make a -- you don't even know the difference between Mexico and the United States.**

*They make a left turn after they go out 20 miles, 40 miles -- 5 miles, in some cases, and less. They make a left turn; they're in the United States. And then they do whatever they have to do. You need the wall. And we can all play games, and we can all talk about technology. I know more about technology than anybody.**

*If you don't have the wall, the technology doesn't work. First of all, the wall is based on -- I mean, it's all based -- any technology works only with the wall. It's not going to work otherwise. You need the wall. In fact, a lot of the technology is put on top of the wall. That's how you see it -- the cameras and everything else.**

*I mean, they literally put the technology -- they fasten it to the wall. Then you have drone technology. And that's great, in terms of -- what are you going to do? Are you going to follow the people? First of all, once they step into the country, you know what happens, right? You know what they do. It's called -- what do they call it? Do you know?**

*Tell me.**

*They put one foot in our country, right? And we got them. That's it. So the drones don't help us. We have to keep it out. We have -- we have no choice but to have a wall or a barrier. And if we don't have that, it's just not going to work. So it's very important to me. All right. One more question.**

*Mr. President, what's your message to federal workers who are missing another paycheck this week and struggling?**

*I love them. I respect them. I really appreciate the great job they're doing. They -- you know, many of those people that are not getting paid are totally in favor of what we're doing because they know the future of this country is dependent on having a strong border, especially a strong southern border because we have tremendous violence and crime coming through that border.**

*We have tremendous drugs. We have the human trafficking. We have MS-13 and gangs pouring through those borders. And if we don't strengthen those borders, we're going to have a big problem in the future. And one of the people I blame is myself because the economy is so strong right now -- stronger than ever before.**

*Today -- today, right now -- we have more people working in the United States than has ever worked in this country before. That's a great compliment. So I blame myself, okay? But the fact is people come up because our country is doing so well, and they want to break through our borders. The fact is we want them to come up. We have a big -- we took in more people last year, legally, than we have in a long time because we need them because we have -- a lot of companies are coming into our country.**

*So we need people coming in. I want people to come in, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit. They have to be able to help companies. And if they don't help companies and if they don't help our country, we can't do that, folks. We just can't do that. All right?**

*Why did you decide to agree to Nancy Pelosi that [Inaudible]?**

*Well, it's really her choice. I mean, I would have done it in a different location, but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union -- to pick some other place. I could have done it. I could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day -- and you've been there many times -- but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union.**

*So what she said, I thought, was actually reasonable: We'll have the State of the Union when the shutdown is over.**

*And when do you think that's going to be?**

*That I can't tell you. That I can't tell you. But we have a lot of alternatives. But we need border security. Okay, thank you very much everybody. Thank you.**

*Another day in paradise, right? [Laughter] A good day. A good day. This is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act that this room is very enthused about, that a lot of people are very enthused about. We're taken advantage of by many, many countries all over the world. They charge us tariffs and taxe -- the likes of which nobody has any understanding, they're so high and so unfair.**

*They also have barriers where we can't go in. They have trade barriers that make it impossible for us to sell our farm products and our other products or cars in those places. So this is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, and it's really a preliminary meeting. It's a little bit of an early meeting. We're going to be talking about it. We have tremendous support, and we're going to find out what happens.**

*It should have been done many years ago, as many things should have been done many years ago. Frankly, the wall should have been built many years ago; we wouldn't have the problems that we have today. So I'm pleased to welcome Republican members of Congress to the White House. I especially want to thank Congressman Sean Duffy for sponsoring one of the top legislative priorities, to my way of thinking, that you can have.**

*It's called "fairness," really. The United States Reciprocal Trade Act -- this legislation will help finally to give our workers a fair and level playing field against other countries. Countries are taking advantage of us, whether they think we're very nice or not so smart. They've been doing it for many, many years, and we want to end it. Many of these are friends.**

*Many of these are allies. But sometimes allies take advantage of us even more so than our non-allies. All over the world, foreign countries put massive tariffs on our products while we put very few, if any, on theirs. So we then wonder why we're not doing the business we should be doing. And we wonder, maybe most importantly, why we had, last year, over an $800 trillion trade deficient -- $800 billion, in terms of a trade deficit.**

*So when you have a number like $800 billion, you say to yourself, "Somebody made a lot of bad deals." And that's happened over a long period of time. The Reciprocal Trade Act will give us the tools to solve this problem once and for all. In addition to the various trade deals that we're working on with Mexico, Canada, China -- South Korea, we just finished.**

*It's a good deal. Made it a good deal. It was a terrible deal, and we made it into a good deal. We'll get the trade way down and we'll get the deficits way down. Under the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act, whatever the tariffs for a foreign country is, we place the same tariff on us. So if somebody is charging -- and I brought a chart.**

*If somebody is charging us 100 percent tariff, and we're charging them nothing, we're entitled to charge the same tariff as them. And what's going to happen, I think, from a practical standpoint, is they won't be charging us tariffs anymore. We'll see. Or we'll charge them a lot. It's a tremendous amount of money.**

*It's a tremendous problem for our country. The U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act will be an incredible tool to bring foreign countries to the negotiating table and to get them to lower their tariffs on our products and also to get rid of their trade barriers, making it really impossible for us to do business. India, as an example, has a 150 percent -- hard to believe -- tariff on whiskey.**

*They make whiskey, and they sell it to us. We charge them zero. We sell it to them; they charge us 150 percent. So I would say, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Okay? [Laughter] That's the least of it. We have far worse than that. The EU charges us 67 percent tariff on pork, and we charge them almost nothing.**

*And they make it very hard for us to sell pork in the EU. For bulldozers, Malaysia charges us, as an example, 20 percent, and Indonesia charges us a lot. We charge them all nothing. We charge them nothing. Very unfair to our companies. Very unfair to our workers. So if countries refuse to lower their barriers, then we will simply place a matching tariff on their product.**

*It's very simple. It's the simplest thing that you can do. The result will be more countries will remove their barriers and open their markets to American exports, to American farmers, to American manufacturers. I will be talking a lot about reciprocal trade over the next six years. Hopefully, we'll have it done in two years or less.**

*And we will see deficits down to a level that would really -- you know, we talk about "Make America Great Again"; we have to do these things to make America great again. Because we can't lose almost $800 billion on trade, like has been done for many years. And it's been numbers -- they varied anywhere from $300 billion to over $800 billion.**

*Can't do that. And what we're doing with China, I think, will have a tremendous impact, if you look at the numbers that we're talking about. We'll see how that all comes out. But, as you know, we're charging tremendous tariffs now, and they go up, as of March 1st, very substantially. I think China would like to make a deal.**

*We'd like to make a deal. I like exactly where we are right now, to be honest with you. We're very happy. We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury -- billions -- from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in. But if we could make a deal that'll be great -- on intellectual property, and theft, and all of the other things we're talking about, in addition to taxes themselves.**

*So I'll be talking a lot about this over the next period of time, and I want to just thank the incredible people -- all friends of mine. They are -- this is a very early meeting. This is the beginning of something, I think, that's going to be very important for our country. And I look forward to discussing it. They did a chart, right here, where, as an example, these are -- and these are not big abuses.**

*You look at apples. Japan, foreign tariff -- 17 percent. The United States -- nothing. We get nothing; they get 17. The same apple. Actually, ours are better, you want to know the truth. [Laughter] So that makes it even worse. I don't want to cover you up. You're such a good-looking guy,**

*No, you're good. You're good.**

*He's a handsome man. I don't want to cover him up. Autos, China -- you have a 15 percent tariff, and the U.S. has 2.5. So when you sell -- and, by the way, we got the autos down from 40 in China. I got them down to 15. But it's still 15 percent versus 2.5 percent. But, if you know, it was 40 and 25 percent.**

*We got them down to 15, but that's really not good enough because we have 15 versus 2.5 percent. And we don't even get the 2.5 percent. There are ways that they can eliminate that. French fries -- one of our favorite meals. [Laughter] French fries from Thailand -- 30 percent. We get 8 percent. You look at the numbers.**

*Go down -- look at motorcycles, as an example. India -- 50 percent. It was 100 percent. I got them down to 50 percent just by talking for about two minutes. But it's still 50 percent versus 2.4 percent. Again, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Pork, EU -- pretty much zero. And it's 67 percent. So you look at that, and something like whiskey from India, and other things from India -- India is a very high tariff.**

*They charge us a lot of tariffs. But you look at whiskey. So India gets 150 percent, and we get nothing. I will tell you that those are just a few of the products. It's actually much worse than that, as bad as that sounds. And all we're saying -- if you're going to charge us 150 percent, we're going to charge you 150 percent.**

*And what will happen, in many cases, is we'll both charge each other nothing or we'll get 150 percent. That's okay, too. I spoke to a couple senators about this that are really into this stuff, and they said, "Hey, sounds fair to me." And a lot of people think it's fair. We have to get foreign countries to respect us again, both militarily and on trade.**

*And I tell you, we have come a long way in two years. It's a whole different ballgame. When you look at what's happened, it's a whole different ballgame. So this is the Reciprocal Trade Act, and I think that it's something that's going to -- you're going to hear a lot about it. And, you know, hard to believe -- you'll have people that are against it. You'll have people say that we don't mind if a country charges us 50 percent, 100 percent, 250 percent.**

*We have some cases, like with butter -- Sean was telling me -- in Wisconsin. Do you want to tell that story? The difference?**

*Yeah, so Europe charges us 68 percent tariffs on our Wisconsin butter, and we charge 2.8 percent on European butter. It's totally unfair. It's not right.**

*Mister great hockey player, congratulations on your victory. We worked hard, right?**

*Thank you, Mr. President.**

*That was a great job. Great job. Thank you.**

*We appreciate your support.**

*[Inaudible] Thank you very much. Congratulations. So thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.**

*[Inaudible] with this idea of the temporary spending measure to reopen the government, allow federal workers to --**

*Well, one of the ideas suggested is they open it, they pay a -- sort of a prorated down payment for the wall, which I think people agree that you need. You need the wall. In fact, I see a lot of the Democrats are all -- almost all of them are breaking and saying, "Look, walls are good. Walls are good." Big difference from what you had two or three weeks ago.**

*And the vote -- we had the vote on our bill, which we won 50-47. That was our bill. But we got one Democrat. It was 50-47. And we need -- as you know, we have to get 60. We don't have 60 votes, so we need Democrat support. We didn't get Democrat support, other than from a -- actually, a wonderful man, as you know -- Senator Manchin.**

*And he's doing the right thing for his people. I mean, he's doing the right thing for West Virginia, frankly. And the other bill -- it was 52-44. And that included a lot of hurricane relief for a lot of different states. So it's sort of not something -- some of them really voted for the hurricane relief, which they felt they needed.**

*That was 52-44. But you need 60. So that didn't go anywhere. So we knew they both were not going to go anywhere, we thought. And now Mitch is negotiating with Chuck Schumer, and we'll see what happens. I think they just left a meeting. They just had a meeting. I think they're going to have to see their people.**

*But they just left. So we have two bills. I think we did very well. The Republicans held. Except for two, the Republicans held. Two were not there. They couldn't -- they weren't able to be there, so there were two non-votes. But even with two non-votes, I think they would have been good votes for us. It's 50-47; we won.**

*But we need 60 votes because of the 60-vote rule. And so I just really want to thank the Republicans for holding. Again, on the other one, that was the opening up. That's 52-44, but you need 60 votes. So it's a long way short. And a lot of that -- a lot of those votes were based on the fact that there was hurricane relief for certain states.**

*[Inaudible] temporary spending without money for the wall, which is just to reopen the government --**

*Well, I wouldn't be happy with it. I wouldn't be happy. But we have a lot of alternatives. Honestly, we have -- everybody -- look, for the most part, people agree -- when I say "everybody," I would say almost everybody agrees we have to have border security. We have to have a wall in order to have border security.**

*You cannot have border security without a wall. I mean, we can play games, and we can talk about technology. We can talk about drones flying around. You know, right now, formed, is an 8,000-person caravan. And the caravan is heading our way. Congratulations. We have another one. We stopped the first one.**

*We stopped the second one. I wouldn't say that Tijuana is too happy, but they're happily living in Tijuana right now. And a lot of them have gone back. But we stopped them, but it's very tough. And if we didn't have a wall in those areas, it would have been very hard to stop them. We have the military and we have the Border Patrol; they've done an incredible job.**

*And ICE has done an incredible job all over the country, frankly. We've removed thousands of MS-13 and others out of our country. But if we had a wall, we wouldn't have that problem. It would be great. So we have a lot of alternatives, but I'm just honored that almost all of the Republicans voted for our bill.**

*Our bill is the bill that, I think, we're really focused on. But we had almost all of the Republicans, so the end result was 50-47. The Democrats lost one that came over to our side. So they pretty much held, and we held. And, again, we were missing two Republicans. They couldn't vote. They were not here.**

They're meeting to see if they can work out something, maybe on a temporary basis where we start. But I have -- you know, we have a lot of alternatives.**

I'll tell you who wants this to happen: The military wants this to happen because this is a virtual invasion of our country -- of drugs, of human traffickers, of so many different things, of criminals. It's an invasion of our country. And the military wants this to happen, and the Border Patrol wants this to happen.**

*And, by the way, Border Patrol said all of the drones flying up in the air -- having a lot of fun, flying drones all over the place -- they don't mean a thing when they look down and they see thousands of people rushing our border. The only thing that works is a strong barrier or wall.**

*Yes.**

*On Venezuela, I just want to know: Aren't you worried to leave the American diplomats behind?**

*Well, we're looking at Venezuela. It's a very sad situation. That was the richest state in all of that area. That's a big, beautiful area, and by far the richest. And now it's one of the poorest places in the world. That's what socialism gets you, when they want to raise your taxes to 70 percent. You know, it's interesting, I've been watching our opponents -- our future opponents -- talking about 70 percent.**

Are you going to follow the people? First of all, once they step into the country, you know what happens, right? You know what they do. It's called -- what do they call it? Do you know?**

*Tell me.**

*They put one foot in our country, right? And we got them. That's it. So the drones don't help us. We have to keep it out. We have -- we have no choice but to have a wall or a barrier. And if we don't have that, it's just not going to work. So it's very important to me. All right. One more question.**

*Mr. President, what's your message to federal workers who are missing another paycheck this week and struggling?**

*I love them. I respect them. I really appreciate the great job they're doing. They -- you know, many of those people that are not getting paid are totally in favor of what we're doing because they know the future of this country is dependent on having a strong border, especially a strong southern border because we have tremendous violence and crime coming through that border.**

*We have tremendous drugs. We have the human trafficking. We have MS-13 and gangs pouring through those borders. And if we don't strengthen those borders, we're going to have a big problem in the future. And one of the people I blame is myself because the economy is so strong right now -- stronger than ever before.**

*Today -- today, right now -- we have more people working in the United States than has ever worked in this country before. That's a great compliment. So I blame myself, okay? But the fact is people come up because our country is doing so well, and they want to break through our borders. The fact is we want them to come up. We have a big -- we took in more people last year, legally, than we have in a long time because we need them because we have -- a lot of companies are coming into our country.**

*So we need people coming in. I want people to come in, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit. They have to be able to help companies. And if they don't help companies and if they don't help our country, we can't do that, folks. We just can't do that. All right?**

*Why did you decide to agree to Nancy Pelosi that [Inaudible]?**

*Well, it's really her choice. I mean, I would have done it in a different location, but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union -- to pick some other place. I could have done it. I could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day -- and you've been there many times -- but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union.**

*So what she said, I thought, was actually reasonable: We'll have the State of the Union when the shutdown is over.**

*And when do you think that's going to be?**

*That I can't tell you. That I can't tell you. But we have a lot of alternatives. But we need border security. Okay, thank you very much everybody. Thank you.**

*So, thank you all very much -- very much for being here. And a lot of friends in the room. A lot of great friends. And, Mr. Vice President, thank you. And, Secretary Nielsen, thank you very much. We're doing a great job on the border, considering we don't have the tools. They don't give us the tools to work with, meaning we have to have a wall.**

*We have to have a barricade of some kind -- a steel barricade. It's already designed. We're building a lot of wall as we speak -- a tremendous amount. And we're renovating a lot of the other wall. Otherwise -- by the way, with what's coming up, because of the strong economy that we have -- we haven't had an economy like this, I guess, in over 50 years.**

*Would you say that's correct, Steve? And because of the strong economy, everyone is pouring up, and we're stopping them. But it's a lot of work. We have incredible people at the border, and you have to thank all of the Border Patrol agents and the ICE agents I see in Long Island. They don't want ICE. The radical Democrats don't want ICE there because they're too good; they're doing too good a job.**

*And I always talk about Long Island; that's one of the real hotbeds for the MS-13 gangs. And I just see this morning, where the, really, radical Democrats don't want them there because they don't want to do anything to disturb MS-13. And when you think about it, MS-13 is about the most violent gang, they say; one of the most violent anywhere in the world.**

*And they have done -- we're sending them out by the thousands out of our country. So we think it's too bad. But I would say this: That the State of the Union speech has been cancelled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn't want to hear the truth. She doesn't want the American public to hear what's going on. And she's afraid of the truth.**

*And the super-left Democrats, the radical Democrats -- what's going on in that Party is shocking. I know many people that were Democrats and they're switching over right now, and they're switching over quickly. So I hope they know what they're doing for their Party. So far, they haven't. If you know, I won the Senate -- meaning we won the Senate altogether -- but we get no credit for that.**

*They don't talk about that. They talk about the House. I didn't have any chance to -- other than a couple of people, like from Kentucky, where I went and campaigned for Andy Barr and for some others, they ended up winning their races. But I couldn't campaign too much. Too many people. But we did a great job with the Senate, and people don't want to talk about it. I will say that the American people want to hear the truth.**

*They have to hear the truth. And the truth is all about -- and said, I think and I hope, well -- we were planning on doing a really very important speech in front of the House and the Senate, the Supreme Court, and everybody else that's there. It's called the State of the Union. It's in the Constitution.**

*We're supposed to be doing it. And now, Nancy Pelosi -- or "Nancy," as I call her -- she doesn't want to hear the truth, and she doesn't want to hear -- more importantly, the American people hear the truth. So we just found out that she's cancelled it, and I think that's a great blotch on the incredible country that we all love.**

*It's a great, great, horrible mark. I don't believe it's ever happened before, and it's always good to be part of history. But this is a very negative part of history. This is where people are afraid to open up and say what's going on. So it's a very, very negative part of history. I'd like to start today -- we're talking about shutdown; we're talking about some conservative values.**

*These are the great conservative leaders of our country, and they have very strong views. And we'll be doing that after the press leaves. But they have very strong views on the shutdown. And it's not that we have a choice. I don't think we have a choice. We have to make our country safe. We have done such an incredible job with such poor tools.**

*We have catch-and-release, where you catch somebody and then you have to release that person into our country. We have so many different elements of rule and regulation. It's a very sad thing that's gone on. And this has happened over a long period of time. If you take a look at the visa lottery -- when there's a lottery, do you think they're putting their best people into those lotteries?**

*It's a lottery. You know what a lottery is. Does anybody think they're putting their best people in? You have chain migration, where, as an example, the killer -- the man who ran over people on the West Side Highway in New York -- 8 people killed, 12 injured. And when you say "12 injured," nobody knows how badly injured they are.**

*This isn't like they had a headache. This is big, big, and horrible problems. Loss of legs and arms, and worse. And this man brought in many people -- many, many people -- through chain migration, it's called. So these are all Democrat principles that are no good for our country; they're hurting our country.**

*And if we did what we had to do, you would bring crime down in half in our country, because so much of it comes through our southern border. Honduras is doing nothing for us. Guatemala is doing nothing for us. El Salvador is doing nothing for us. And we pay them hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but we're going to be stopping pretty soon.**

*In fact, we're looking at it right now. We don't want to do it. Because when caravans form in the middle of a country, the country can very easily stop those caravans from forming, very easily. I actually think they encourage the caravans because they want to get rid of the people from their country, and certain people.**

*A lot of gang members are there. In the last caravan, we had 618 people with criminal records, and some of them very serious records. I won't soon forget the man that was interviewed where he wanted some kind of pardon, or whatever, when he came into the country. And the network person said, "Well, what did you do?" And he said "murder" or something to that effect.**

*And she goes, "Whoa, murder." Well, we have -- that's what we have. We have a lot of very dangerous people that want to come into our country. And we're not letting them in. We want people to come in based on merit. We want people to come in that can help us successfully run all these companies that are pouring into the United States because of what we've done and because of all of the incentives, Steve, that we've given, and because this is where the action is. Steve Moore is one of the great financial gurus, and he would tell you how well we're doing as a country.**

*But we have a lot of people that, really, we need. We have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in much more than 50 years, with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American. We have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in the history of our country. And that's why, when you look at the Hispanic polls, I'm up 19 percent.**

*And the reason I'm up 19 percent -- I don't even think it's the unemployment; I think it's the fact that they understand, better than anybody, what's going on at the border. And they say that President Trump is the only one that's saying it right, and he's doing what you have to. That's why people were so surprised when they saw the poll that just came out, where I'm up to 50 percent with the Hispanic and up 19 points in a short period of time.**

*Because they get it better than anybody at the border. They know what's happening at the border and they know it's a big scam. And the Democrats don't want to stop people. That means automatically massive amounts of crime. And we're not going to put up with it. So Nancy Pelosi, knowing these facts, and knowing it's something that she can't win, that she just went out and said, let's cancel -- for the first time in the history of our country -- "Let's cancel the State of the Union Address." And it's a disgrace.**

*Just so you know, she uses on the basis of the shutdown. But when she asked me to make the address -- formally, in writing; most of you have a copy of the letter -- when she asked me to make the address, she did it during the shutdown -- well into the shutdown, by a couple of weeks. So the shutdown was going on. Now she's blaming the shutdown.**

*So if it was because of the shutdown, why do you ask that the address be made? And she asked that the address be made during a shutdown, and now she's blaming the shutdown. She also knew -- because she went to our people and she asked, "Would it be a security problem?" She knew it wasn't a security problem.**

*She blamed security, but she knew it wasn't a security problem, and she knew that loud and clear. And she went to the people. She asked. They said, "We have no problem whatsoever." I just got back from Iraq. I was very safe in Iraq, and I felt very safe. We had great, great security. If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington in a very, very spectacular building, and a beautiful room that we should be in, and that's where it's been for a very long time.**

*So it's a sad thing for our country. We'll do something in the alternative. We'll be talking to you about that at a later date. But I have to say, it's an honor to have these great leaders with us, and we're going to be talking about shutdown. We're going to be talking about other things. And we're going to be talking about -- outside of this event that we just discussed -- how well our country is doing, because we're setting records in so many different ways.**

*We're setting jobs records. Right now, at this very moment, we have more people working in the United States than at any time in the history of our country. Think of that. That's a big, big statement. I just had a meeting on drug pricing and various other things. And prescription drugs, for the first time in history -- the history of our country -- have gone down in 2018. So for last year -- just got the numbers -- for the first time in the history of our country, prescription drug prices have gone down.**

*They've been like a rocket ship until I got here. And we have more to do. They're going to go down further. But think of that: For the first time -- I say it because you guys don't want to report it, but that's a big thing, because drug pricing has been very important to me, as is healthcare. First time in the history of our country, in 2018, prescription drug prices have gone down.**

*That's a big number. And you didn't even know that. I don't think anybody at this table knew that. It just came out. So we'll let you know. So it's too bad with Nancy Pelosi, what she's done. It's radical Democrats. They've become a radicalized party. They really have. They have become a radicalized party.**

*I actually think they've become a very dangerous party for this country. If you listen to what they're saying, what they're doing, I think they've become a very dangerous -- a very, very dangerous party for this country. I think that Chuck Schumer, sadly, is dominated by the radical left, and he is dominated by Nancy Pelosi.**

*Very strongly dominated. He can't move; he's a puppet. He's a puppet for Nancy Pelosi, if you can believe that. But that's what's become and that's what's happening. And we're not going to let it happen to our nation, and we are not going to allow the radical left to control our borders. Because if they do, you will see crime; you will see drugs; you will see human trafficking like you have never seen ever in the history of our country.**

*You will never see anything like what you would see. So we will never let the radical left control our borders. Thank you very much. Thank you.**

*Mr. President, are you not giving the speech on Tuesday night?**

*We'll be announcing what we're doing.**

*Sir, she said it's not cancelled but that she wants to come to an agreeable date. So, will you agree to a new date?**

*We'll see. We'll see. Well, it wouldn't be very hard, but that's not what she means. And it's very sad. I think it's a very, very bad thing for our country, and it's a horrible precedent. And we have many positive things to say, but we also have things that we want to turn into positives that are big negatives.**

*The southern border is a very, very big deal. It should've been handled by other Presidents for many times, just like Israel with the -- if you look, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Every President talked about it; nobody did it until I came along. Same thing in a certain, different way with the southern border.**

*It should've been stopped a long time ago. They talked about it. They had approvals for doing it, and they were unable to pull it off. Other Presidents should've done this. We're going to do it. And it's not because I want to, it's because I have no choice. Because if we don't do it, this country is going to be worse than any -- at any time in our history in terms of drug infestation and in terms of crime.**

*And our crime numbers are really good, but our crime numbers would be very much better if we had a stopped-up southern border. And, by the way, the caravan now, they're saying, is massive. The caravan that's coming up. Thank you very much, Honduras. We send Honduras hundreds of millions of dollars, and they send us caravans.**

*The three of those countries. And, you know, as I said, we're probably going to be stopping that. We're working on that right now. I would stop it. Because, you know, you have two theories: You can give more and let them do economic development, or you can do less. I'm of the less theory. I don't think we should give anything to them.**

*And we've done this with numerous countries over the world where they're not treating us right. We have countries that get hundreds of millions of dollars -- they don't even vote for us at the United Nations, until we say we're not going to pay you anymore, and then they immediately vote for us. So, you know, but that's not a -- I don't call that a vote.**

*So I want to thank everybody very much. We're going to have a great meeting. And we will have a response to Nancy Pelosi in due course. But what she's doing to the American people, what she is doing to our Constitution, is a disgrace. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody.**

We have countries that get hundreds of millions of dollars -- they don't even vote for us at the United Nations, until we say we're not going to pay you anymore, and then they immediately vote for us. So, you know, but that's not a -- I don't call that a vote.**

*So I want to thank everybody very much. We're going to have a great meeting. And we will have a response to Nancy Pelosi in due course. But what she's doing to the American people, what she is doing to our Constitution, is a disgrace. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody.**

*Thank you all for being here. I especially want to thank Secretary Azar and Secretary Acosta -- they're doing a fantastic job -- for everything they're doing with respect to healthcare, and more affordable healthcare at that, for the American people. It's incredible some of the things we've come up with that are much less expensive than Obamacare, and in many respects, are much, much better.**

*People have to know about the options. We have a lot of options, and people have to know that. We're here today, though, to discuss how the healthcare system too often harms people with unfair surprises. They have some really -- surprises in a very negative sense: medical bills and the like. The pricing is hurting patients, and we've stopped a lot of it, and we're going to stop all of it. It is very important to me. My administration is committed to delivering a healthcare system that takes care of American people -- of the American people, and like they haven’t been taken care of before.**

*And we can do that. It's a very difficult subject, it's a very complex subject, but we've all gotten to understand it very well. And the strides we've made are rather amazing. We want to take advantage of those strides now, and we want to let them be known to the American people, as we make additional headway.**

*We've already made that progress. In certain way we're lowering, and we will continue to lower, healthcare costs. We approved a record number of generic drugs over the past two years. If you look at what we've done -- and we're going to be putting out a list at the end of the week -- the number of generic drugs, which brings down the pricing.**

*They're just as good as the name drug. In fact, one of things that amazed me -- I was asking a few of the people, including Scott -- I was saying that, "What's the difference between the generic and a big-name drug where you pay much more money?" And they said, "Absolutely no difference." Do you still agree with that?**

*I mean, Secretary, do you still --**

*Absolutely.**

*So, somebody is going to have to explain, why are they paying for the brand? Will somebody explain that please? Because they literally say there's absolutely no difference. Identical. And you'll pay four, five, six times more money for something that comes in a container that you're more familiar with. So we've expanded that greatly -- a lot of generic drugs.**

*Through the association health plans -- thank you, Secretary Acosta -- we've expanded access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, particularly for employees of small businesses and self-employed individuals. And we reduced average premiums on the federal Obamacare exchanges for the first time in the history of the horrible Obamacare.**

*Okay? It's the first time it's ever happened. We're working very hard to get those -- the pricing down, as we really do things that are going to make it much better, and ultimately, it will result probably in a court case termination, and then we'll all get together and we'll come up with real healthcare.**

*As the result of our efforts, prescription drug prices have declined in 2018 for the first time in over 50 years. So, prescription drug pricing has been very important to me. Think of that statement: For the first time in over 50 years, it's gone down in pricing. Is that a correct statement?**

*That's correct.**

*Because if it's not, you know, they're going to get us. Okay? [Laughter] We'll be looking very strongly, so we have to realize that that's a very powerful statement. First time in over 50 years that prescription drug prices have declined -- that’s in 2018. But the seen and unseen costs of healthcare are still taking an enormous toll on millions of American families.**

*And this is something that I inherited; unfortunately, you inherited it, and also the people inherited. And we're doing a lot about it. Half of all unpaid bills on consumer credit reports in America are for medical bills. One-fifth of credit reports include a past-due medical bill. And you think of so many other bills, but one-fifth -- a big portion of what people are having trouble with right now are medical bills, and we're doing a lot about that.**

*Nearly 40 percent of insured adults report receiving a surprise medical bill in the last year. Patients should know that the real price -- and what's going on with the real prices of procedures, because they don’t know. They go in, they have a procedure, and then all of a sudden they can't afford it. They had no idea it was so bad -- of procedures, treatments, and medicines before they receive them.**

*And this is a big shock to a lot of people, patients and others. When you go to a grocery store, or you go to see a mechanic, you know the prices upfront, and you get a receipt that shows the cost of every item. Every single item. You know exactly what you're paying. You go and get your car fixed and you say, "How much?" But people don’t do that with the medical to the same extent, and they get some very unpleasant surprises.**

*And one of the things that happens is when you don’t make a deal upfront, then the doctor, or whoever it may it be, all of a sudden doubles and triples the price, because they figure you don’t care or you're rich -- you have plenty of money; you don’t have to worry about it. And we don’t want that happening.**

*That’s what we want to do with healthcare so that patients will know exactly what the cost is, what the quality is. And just think of it as a consumer. You're really a consumer at a very high level, and you can get some great healthcare. We have some plans that are great. but you have to go in and price them.**

*So I'd like to hear about some of the experiences of the people around the table. We've had some incredible experiences, some really eye-opening experiences, and we're going to hear that. But before we begin, maybe I'll ask Secretary Acosta to say a few words, and follow it up. Mr. Secretary, please. Okay?**

*Thank you.**

*Mr. President, thank you. You mentioned association health plans, and I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on some of the preliminary results. You asked us, you ordered us to look at these, to make them available or possible. And so far, we've had about 30 association health plans across the nation.**

*We've had two that have gone across multiple states. And I wanted to highlight one in particular. An early adopter was the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce. And so, they had had an association health plan in the past, and so far -- they're still processing -- but they've had more than 500 employers and 100 sole proprietors sign up for this plan.**

*Great.**

*The plan provides quality. It's providing substantial cost savings. For example, a small business where employees used to be paying about $400, $450 per month for healthcare are now on average paying $230 per month. So a 40 percent reduction. And it's quality. It provides a two-year rate lock. It provides and covers preexisting conditions.**

*Dental and vision are available. Health savings accounts are available. And this is the kind of quality that we're seeing in these plans across the nation.**

*And enough people don’t know about it.**

*And people do not know about it, but you're seeing chambers of commerce from Massachusetts to Vermont to Nevada. You've seen the American Veterinary Association that just started a nationwide association health plan. Land O'Lakes that is starting a multistate health plan for farmers. And so as these are commencing, you're seeing incredible cost savings and you're going to see many, many more of these.**

*And better healthcare.**

*And better healthcare.**

*So you get better healthcare -- much better healthcare at a lesser cost. So, you know, people just have to know about it. And it's available now. And are you doing the 401? Or what are you doing with that?**

*So we're also taking the concept of an association health plan and extending it to an association retirement plan where, right now, 14 percent of small businesses -- and only 14 percent -- offer retirement savings to their employees. We wrote a rule -- it's been out for notice and comment -- that would extend the association concept so that these same organizations, whether a chamber of commerce or the American Veterinary Association, can offer 401(k) plans.**

*So instead of every small business having a separate 401 [K), you can have large, centralized 401(k] plans. And not only does this eliminate paperwork, not only does it allow more employees to access retirement savings, but a small 401 [K)'s fees are much larger than a large 401(k]. And so you're looking at about a 1 percent fee saving per year with these association retirement plans.**

*One percent over a lifetime is incredibly meaningful to all of these employees. And then finally, we're working on the reimbursement accounts -- the health reimbursement arrangements -- where employers can give their employees cash. So those employees can go out and they can buy their own healthcare. It provides more options.**

*It provides more flexibility. And that’s one project that I'm working with Secretary Azar on. It's out for notice and comment, as well. And we're very excited about the possibilities.**

*So when will you have all of your various plans out, would you say?**

*And so, they're both out for notice and comment. And I would expect certainly the association [Inaudible] by spring.**

*Good. Okay, great. Thank you. Great job. Mr. Secretary?**

*Well, thank you, Mr. President, for welcoming us here today to discuss this, really, very important topic. Like all of the Trump administration, HHS knows the right way to bring down costs while improving quality in any area is to empower consumers and to employ market forces. This can't be accomplished without transparent pricing information.**

*It's got to be meaningful price signals. But in healthcare, prices are often hidden, far out of line with what many patients will owe, or both. Making prices more transparent can protect patients from the kinds of awful stories that we're going to hear about today, and bring down costs for everybody in both healthcare services and prescription drugs.**

*People should have the right to know what a service or a drug will cost them before they have to buy that service or drug. One key area is healthcare services. We've already started bringing transparency to hospital prices. Starting on January the 1st, hospitals are now required for the first time to post their list of sticker prices online in a machine-readable format, which is a historic first step in much bigger efforts around transparency.**

*The data has to be machine-readable so that patients can use private sector solutions, like apps, that can help them understand this data. Ultimately, patients should know a service's price and the price that they're going to really pay -- the out-of-pocket -- before they agree to that service. Delivering that is a complex challenge, which we -- and we put out multiple requests for information on how to make that a reality.**

*And this is a problem not just for the folks who are visiting us from around the table. None of us are immune -- myself included. Several years ago, my doctor wanted me to get a relatively routine diagnostic test. He then sent me within his complex, from his office, over to the hospital unit of this facility, where -- because I had a high deductible plan -- I asked how much it would cost.**

*Do you know what I was told? "We can’t tell you." Well, because I was a former deputy secretary of HHS, I pushed and pushed, and I didn’t -- and I said, "You're going to tell me what this is going to cost." And eventually, he told me: $5,500. Well, I went on my phone and I quickly checked a very reliable healthcare site run by an insurance plan, and said, "If this very basic diagnostic were done in a doctor's office -- in the doctor's office, not in the hospital -- it should cost $550." And I said, "Okay, so $5,500. How much with my insurance company is the negotiated discount?**

*What will I pay given my insurance company." "We can't tell you." "What do you mean you can't tell me?" And I fought, and fought, and fought. And eventually they told me. "$3,500." So, armed with that information, I took the plastic wristband off and walked out of the facility, and didn’t get the test done.**

*But we have a right to know this information. We have a right to be demanding customers, because if that happens, we have a right to take that plastic wristband off and walk out of that facility, and not get a surprise bill when we get home, months later. Many individuals, like the horrific stories we're going to hear today, who cannot afford those types of bills.**

*And we know that employers and insurers who pair price transparency with incentives have driven costs down. This works. In one study, costs for imaging -- like what I was going to have -- were driven down almost 20 percent while price disparities across providers also narrowed. Another key area that the President mentioned for transparency is around prescription drugs.**

*And the President has put forth the first-ever proposal to require disclosing the list prices of drugs in TV ads. Many patients pay based on their prices in deductibles or co-insurance, based off of the list price of these drugs. And they've got a right to know that information. And earlier this year, the President put out a regulation and then signed legislation banning gag clauses that prevent your pharmacist from telling you if you can get a drug at a lower cost by simply paying out of pocket for that drug than by using your insurance.**

*One study suggested that 23 percent of patients are paying more in co-pays than -- at the pharmacy than they would if they simply paid in cash. And the President and Congress delivered that relief and transparency to America's patients. We also are concerned about the issue of rebates. And, Mr. President, you asked about the issue of "why would anyone ever take a branded drug when there is a generic available." One of the most common reasons is because a pharmacy benefit manager is getting a rebate payment from that branded company to steer you to use the branded drug, rather than the much, much, much lower cost generic.**

*We're concerned that patients and payers are left in the dark about the hundreds of billions of dollars in rebates being paid from drug manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers, or so-called middlemen. These payments are non-transparent and they distort these prices, and create bad incentives in our system.**

*Marty Makary, whom we have here today, has done remarkable work showing how neither patients nor employers who pay for insurance know what's going on with these rebates and prices. Bringing down prices in healthcare, as this President has promised to do, ultimately has to involve in making sure everybody knows and understands these prices, they're transparent, and they're available.**

*Thank you very much, Mr. President.**

*Well, thank you very much. And thanks for the great job. And remember, as we get ready to leave the media, prescription drug prices in 2018 went down for the first time in over 50 years. And that’s not by accident; that’s because we did a lot of hard work, and it's going to continue to go down. And we're finally getting drug prices down for the American people.**

*And this was a one-way street up. And now, for the first time in over 50 years, prescription drug prices have gone down. So we're very proud of that. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.**

*Mr. President, you made an announcement about Venezuela today. Some administration officials told reporters in a conference call that all options are on the table. Are you considering a military option for Venezuela?**

*We're not considering anything, but all options are on the table.**

*Does that mean you're considering a military --**

*We're just -- all options, always. All options are on the table.**

*Mr. President, Nancy Pelosi just responded and she said she will not consider a concurrent resolution to have you come to the House on January 29th to deliver your State of the Union. Your response to the House Speaker?**

*I'm not surprised. It's really a shame what's happening with the Democrats. They've become radicalized. They don’t want to see crime stopped, which we can very easily do on the southern border. And it really is a shame what's happening with the Democrats. This will go on for a while. Ultimately, the American people will have their way, because they want to see no crime, they want to see what we're doing.**

*Like, today, we lowered prescription drug prices, the first time in 50 years. They want to see that. The Democrats would never have been able to do that. So we're all working very hard. We'll have to respond to it. We'll respond to it in a timely manner. Thank you very much everybody.**

*How likely are you to get a deal with the Chinese next week?**

*China very much wants to make a deal. We'll see what happens. I like where we are right now. We're doing great as an economy. They're not doing very well because of the tariffs. But, as you know, fairly soon, that -- the deal that I made with them will come off. The tariffs will be substantially increased on China.**

*They're paying billions of dollars to the United States Treasury. First time we've ever done that. First time we've ever had money coming the other way from China. It's always been a one-way street. But I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and we'll see what happens. But we're doing very well in our negotiation with China.**

*One way or the other, it doesn’t matter -- one way or the other, we're going to do well.**

*The story from Michael Cohen delaying his testimony -- he says he's been threatened by you and Mr. Giuliani. He and his family have been threatened. What's your --**

*No, I would say he's been threatened by the truth. He's only been threatened by the truth. And he doesn't want to do that probably for me, or other of his clients. He has other clients also, I assume. And he doesn’t want to tell the truth for me, or other of his clients. Okay, thank you very much, everybody.**

*Marty Makary, whom we have here today, has done remarkable work showing how neither patients nor employers who pay for insurance know what's going on with these rebates and prices. Bringing down prices in healthcare, as this President has promised to do, ultimately has to involve in making sure everybody knows and understands these prices, they're transparent, and they're available.**

*Thank you very much, Mr. President.**

*Well, thank you very much. And thanks for the great job. And remember, as we get ready to leave the media, prescription drug prices in 2018 went down for the first time in over 50 years. And that’s not by accident; that’s because we did a lot of hard work, and it's going to continue to go down. And we're finally getting drug prices down for the American people.**

*And this was a one-way street up. And now, for the first time in over 50 years, prescription drug prices have gone down. So we're very proud of that. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.**

*Mr. President, you made an announcement about Venezuela today. Some administration officials told reporters in a conference call that all options are on the table. Are you considering a military option for Venezuela?**

*We're not considering anything, but all options are on the table.**

*Does that mean you're considering a military --**

*We're just -- all options, always. All options are on the table.**

*Mr. President, Nancy Pelosi just responded and she said she will not consider a concurrent resolution to have you come to the House on January 29th to deliver your State of the Union. Your response to the House Speaker?**

*I'm not surprised. It's really a shame what's happening with the Democrats. They've become radicalized. They don’t want to see crime stopped, which we can very easily do on the southern border. And it really is a shame what's happening with the Democrats. This will go on for a while. Ultimately, the American people will have their way, because they want to see no crime, they want to see what we're doing.**

*Like, today, we lowered prescription drug prices, the first time in 50 years. They want to see that. The Democrats would never have been able to do that. So we're all working very hard. We'll have to respond to it. We'll respond to it in a timely manner. Thank you very much everybody.**

*How likely are you to get a deal with the Chinese next week?**

*China very much wants to make a deal. We'll see what happens. I like where we are right now. We're doing great as an economy. They're not doing very well because of the tariffs. But, as you know, fairly soon, that -- the deal that I made with them will come off. The tariffs will be substantially increased on China.**

*They're paying billions of dollars to the United States Treasury. First time we've ever done that. First time we've ever had money coming the other way from China. It's always been a one-way street. But I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and we'll see what happens. But we're doing very well in our negotiation with China.**

*One way or the other, it doesn’t matter -- one way or the other, we're going to do well.**

*The story from Michael Cohen delaying his testimony -- he says he's been threatened by you and Mr. Giuliani. He and his family have been threatened. What's your --**

*No, I would say he's been threatened by the truth. He's only been threatened by the truth. And he doesn't want to do that probably for me, or other of his clients. He has other clients also, I assume. And he doesn’t want to tell the truth for me, or other of his clients. Okay, thank you very much, everybody.**

*I might begin my saying that, to the best of our knowledge -- it goes back a long way -- this is the first such swearing-in that we've ever had in the great Oval Office. So that's a pretty big honor right there. That's pretty good. Now, they may find something back 100 years ago, I don't know.**

*But we looked and we couldn't find it. So -- Please, sit down. Please. Secretary Nielsen, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. And I am truly thrilled to welcome the five newest members of our great American family. That's what you are -- an American family. Thank you. [Applause] You are now official United States citizens.**

*You have just earned the most prized possession anywhere in the world. We know that. There is no higher honor or greater privilege than becoming an American citizen. Our whole nation embraces you with open arms and joyful hearts. And I know that you will treasure this day forever. And it's my honor to be with you, and we'll say that.**

*Each of you worked hard for this moment. You followed the rules, upheld our laws, and contributed to the strength and success and vitality of our nation. Now each of you stands here today, before your proud and beaming families -- look at those families, huh? -- in the Oval Office of the White House. A very special place.**

*I look, and sometimes they say, "Wow, this is it." Right? The Oval Office. So, congratulations. I'd like to share a few brief words about each of our new citizens. Estabraq Adel Al Sayyad came with her husband to the United States -- please. That's a good idea. I wasn't going to do that, but I like that. [Laughter]**

*Please. That's very nice. With her husband to the United States from Iraq in 2013. She is the proud mother of two children and is expecting a third. Since coming to America, she has become a teacher's assistant in our public schools -- doing a fantastic job, I might add -- preparing the next generation of young Americans to make the most of this magnificent country that she, too, now enjoys.**

*And I want to just congratulate you, Estabraq. Thank you. [Applause] Matthew Hemsley is from the United Kingdom. Thank you, Matthew. He is an Anglican pastor who came to the United States in 2006 and earned a master's degree from Gordon Conwell Seminary in North Carolina. A fine place. His grandmother was an American citizen whose ancestors first came to North America in 1637 -- that means you beat us -- [Laughter] -- you beat all of us -- as part of the Plymouth Colony.**

*Now the Hemsley family history to the United States is renewed, and the next chapter of their American story begins. Matthew, it's an honor. Great luck. Great luck. [Applause] Yook Young Choi is from South Korea and came to the United States in 1992 to pursue a master's degree. She earned a PhD from the University of Maryland and is now a professor at Azusa Pacific University.**

*Her husband teaches statistics at George Mason, and -- it's a great school too, by the way -- and they are proud parents of two sons. I want to congratulate you, and you're going to have a great time. Great time. Thank you very much. We really appreciate it. [Applause] Appreciate you being a member of the family.**

*Thank you. Robert Castle is from Jamaica, and he immigrated to the United States in 2009 as the husband of a then-active duty service member of the United States Army. Robert is a warehouse supervisor -- a strong guy, a smart guy -- and they have a beautiful four-year-old son who was born here in the United States.**

*Robert, congratulations. Thank you. [Applause] Marcelo Ramos Ramirez is from Bolivia and has a beautiful, lawful permanent resident of the United States, and has been since 2013. He is the co-owner of a staffing company with his son Marcio. The business is thriving. He's doing really well. And it's expanding in all different ways.**

*He says, "I know that in the [United States] you can achieve anything that you want, and I am a perfect example." In another words, he's making a lot of money. [Laughter] Marcelo, thank you very much. [Applause] You're all at the beginning of a new and extraordinary adventure. With the rights and freedoms you enjoy as Americans, there is nothing you cannot achieve.**

*But citizenship is also a profound responsibility. Each year, over 700,000 new Americans take the oath and allegiance, and inherit a legacy of liberty and justice that generations of Americans fought and died to secure. By taking this oath, you have forged a sacred bond with this nation, its traditions, its culture, and its values.**

*This heritage is now yours to protect, promote, and pass down to the next generation and to the next wave of newcomers to our shores. Our history is now your history. Our traditions are now your traditions. And our Constitution is now yours to safeguard, celebrate, and cherish. As Americans, and American citizens, we are bound together in love, and loyalty, and friendship, and affection.**

*We must look out for each other, care for each other, and always act in the best interests of our nation and all citizens living here today. We love each other. We're proud of each other. The beauty and majesty of citizenship is that it draws no distinctions of race, or class, or faith, or gender or background.**

*No matter where our story begins, whether we are the first generation or the tenth generation, we are all equal. We are one team and one people proudly saluting one great American flag. Again, I want to congratulate you and welcome you to the family. It's a family. It's a beautiful family. It's a family doing very well.**

*We're setting records economically. Our economy is the hottest in the world, and it's continuing, and continuing upward. Our unemployment is the best it's been in more than 50 years. And for certain individuals, it's the best it's ever been, historically. It will probably soon be now for everybody. It's an honor to have you. God bless you. God bless America. Congratulations. [Applause] Thank you.**

*So, I'm going to Dover Air Force Base. A very sad occasion. We'll then be back, and we have a very busy day planned. We had a very good meeting yesterday with North Korea. That was an incredible meeting. It lasted almost two hours. And we've agreed to meet sometime probably at the end of February. We've picked the country, but we'll be announcing it in the future.**

*Kim Jong Un is looking very forward to it and so am I. We've made a lot of progress that has not been reported by the media, but we have made a lot of progress as far as denuclearization is concerned. And we're talking about a lot of different things. But we've made tremendous progress that has not been reported, unfortunately, but it will be. Things are going very well with North Korea.**

*Things are going very well with China and with trade. There were some false reports about sanctions being removed. We have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the United States because of the sanctions. And we'll see how it goes. And if we make a deal, certainly we wouldn't have sanctions. And if we don't make a deal, we will.**

*But I think China has been -- we've really had a very extraordinary number of meetings, and a deal could very well happen with China. It's going very well; I would say about as well as it could possibly go, and without a question.**

*Mr. President, what goes through your mind in moments like this when you're about to visit with relatives of Americans killed in Syria?**

*I think it's the toughest thing I have to do. When I'm going to meet relatives of some of our great, great heroes that have fallen, I think it might be the toughest thing I have to do as President.**

*[Inaudible] ISIS in Syria [Inaudible]?**

*Well, what we've done is we've -- when I took over, Syria was loaded with ISIS. And again, when you say -- and I've always said, who are we killing ISIS for? You know, the worst enemy of Russia, Iran, Syria, if you look at it, is ISIS. So we're killing ISIS for people that aren't necessarily always in agreement with us, let's put it that way.**

*We've gone into Syria, and in two years we've, I guess, reduced it to about 99 percent of the territorial caliphate. Now, that doesn't mean you're not going have somebody around. And who knows what happened and who it was, because nobody is sure. But I will say this: We've taken it -- Syria was a mess.**

*We've done Assad a very big favor. We've also done our country a favor. But we've brought it down to less than 1 percent. As you know, we didn't stop. We can be pulling back but we've been hitting ISIS very hard over the last three weeks. In particular over the last three weeks. And it's moving along very well.**

*It's moving along very well. But when I took over, it was a total mess. But you do have to ask yourself: We're killing ISIS for Russia, for Iran, for Syria, for Iraq, for a lot of other places. At some point, you want to bring our people back home. I've been talking about this since the campaign. But we've done a very -- we're down to 99 percent.**

*We have control of 99 percent and we're hitting the rest of it very, very powerfully over the last three weeks.**

*Will you announce a national emergency today?**

*Well, I'm going to be making a statement at three o'clock, Steve. I hope you'll be there. But I think it will be an important statement having to do with the -- as, you know, caravans are coming up. They have a big one coming up now. I'm disappointed that Mexico is not stopping them. I mean, Mexico seems, unfortunately, powerless to stop them.**

*Many got through. They broke through the Mexican area where, in theory, they were guarded. And they weren't so well guarded. So you have a lot of people in caravans coming up. If we had a wall, we wouldn't have a problem. But we don't; we have too many open areas. The walls that we fixed and the walls that we built hold beautifully, but we have a lot of open areas, and it's too bad.**

*Now, the previous caravans we've stopped. They're right now in Tijuana. I don't know what they're doing in Tijuana but they're not in our country, that I can tell you.**

*What's your message to Democrats going to be during your address? Are you going to [Inaudible]?**

*Well, you're going to see at 3 o'clock. You'll see at 3 o'clock.**

*[Inaudible]**

*Well, I hope that Speaker Pelosi can come along and realize what everybody knows. I mean, no matter who it is, they know that walls work. And we need walls. And whether it's personal or not -- it's not personal for me. She's being controlled by the radical left, which is a problem. And, you know, she's under total control of the radical left.**

*I think that's a very bad thing for her. I think it's a very bad thing for the Democrats. Everybody knows that walls work. If you look at different places they put up a wall -- no problem. If you look at San Antonio, if you look at so many different places, they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities immediately.**

*Immediately. It works. We have to put them up and we will put them up. We got to.**

*You've talked about federal workers. What is your message to those who are lining up at the food banks and [Inaudible]?**

*I think we're making a lot of progress. You know, we're building wall as we speak. Nobody covers that, and I understand that. But we're building wall as we speak. We're going to continue. This country cannot be secure. You have human traffickers. You have criminals of all kind. You have drug pushers and drug smugglers like at a level that people haven't seen over the last five or six years.**

*It's gotten to a point nobody has seen anything like it. The Border Patrol has done an incredible job but we need the help and the backup of a wall. Okay.**

*[Inaudible]**

*Yes, I thought it was -- I thought that the BuzzFeed piece and, maybe equally as bad, the coverage of the BuzzFeed phony story -- it was a total phony story. And I appreciate the Special Counsel coming out with a statement last night. I think it was very appropriate that they did so. I very much appreciate that.**

*I think that the BuzzFeed piece was a disgrace to our country. It was a disgrace to journalism. And I think also that the coverage by the mainstream media was disgraceful. And I think it's going to take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its credibility. It's lost tremendous credibility. And believe me, that hurts me when I see that.**

*I'm the President of this country. Media could pull this country together. It hurts me to say it, but mainstream media has truly lost its credibility. And I can say, as far as I'm concerned, from before the election, during the campaign, I said, "Wow, this is really crooked stuff. This is really dishonest reporting." When the New York Times apologized after the election for their bad coverage and their faulty coverage, and then they were wonderful for two weeks, and then they went back to being worse than ever before.**

*And so many others. I'm not just blaming the Times. But the mainstream media has lost its credibility, and that's a very bad thing for our country. Thank you very much.**

*Just a short time ago, I had the honor of presiding over the swearing-in of five new great American citizens. It was a beautiful ceremony and a moving reminder of our nation’s proud history of welcoming legal immigrants from all over the world into our national family. I told them that the beauty and majesty of citizenship is that it draws no distinctions of race, or class, or faith, or gender or background.**

*All Americans, whether first generation or tenth generation, are bound together in love and loyalty, friendship and affection. We are all equal. We are one team, and one people, proudly saluting one great American flag. We believe in a safe and lawful system of immigration, one that upholds our laws, our traditions, and our most cherished values.**

*Unfortunately, our immigration system has been badly broken for a very long time. Over the decades, many Presidents and many lawmakers have come and gone, and no real progress has been made on immigration. We are now living with the consequences -- and they are tragic -- brought about by decades of political stalemate, partisan gridlock, and national neglect.**

*There is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action. Thousands of children are being exploited by ruthless coyotes and vicious cartels and gangs. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted.**

*Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Drugs kill 78,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border.**

*We can stop heroin. Illegal immigration reduces wages and strains public services. The lack of border control provides a gateway -- and a very wide and open gateway -- for criminals and gang members to enter the United States, including the criminal aliens who murdered a brave California police officer only a day after Christmas.**

*I’ve gotten to know and love Angel moms, dads, and family who lost loved ones to people illegally in our country. I want this to end. It's got to end now. These are not talking points. These are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every single day on both sides of the border.**

*As a candidate for President, I promised I would fix this crisis, and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other. Our immigration system should be the subject of pride, not a source of shame, as it is all over the world. Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction.**

*The good news is, these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right. Both sides in Washington must simply come together, listen to each other, put down their armor, build trust, reach across the aisle, and find solutions. It is time to reclaim our future from the extreme voices who fear compromise and demand open borders, which means drugs pouring in, human trafficking, and a lot of crime.**

*That is why I am here today, to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border. If we are successful in this effort, we will then have the best chance in a very long time at real, bipartisan immigration reform. And it won't stop here.**

*It will keep going until we do it all. The proposal I will outline today is based on, first and foremost, on input from our border agents and homeland security professionals -- and professionals they are. They know what they're doing. It is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border.**

*In recent weeks, we have met with large numbers of Democrat lawmakers to hear their ideas and suggestions. By incorporating the priorities of rank-and-file Democrats in our plan, we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support. And I think many will. This is a commonsense compromise both parties should embrace.**

*The radical left can never control our borders. I will never let it happen. Walls are not immoral. In fact, they are the opposite of immoral because they will save many lives and stop drugs from pouring into our country. Our plan includes the following: $800 million in urgent humanitarian assistance; $805 million for drug detection technology to help secure our ports of entry; an additional 2,750 border agents and law enforcement professionals; 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce the court backlog of, believe it or not, almost 900,000 cases.**

*However, the whole concept of having lengthy trials for anyone who sets one foot in our country unlawfully must be changed by Congress. It is unsustainable. It is ridiculous. Few places in the world would even consider such an impossible nightmare. Our plan includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse.**

*This includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep. To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall.**

*This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high-priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water. We already have many miles of barrier, including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract.**

*It will be done quickly. Our request will add another 230 miles this year in the areas our border agents most urgently need. It will have an unbelievable impact. If we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border, the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced.**

*Some say it could be cut in half. Because these criminals, drug smugglers, gangs, and traffickers do not stop at our border; they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some places where you’d least expect them. They go all over our country. A steel barrier will help us stop illegal immigration while safely directing commerce to our lawful ports of entry.**

*Many of these security ideas have been proposed by Democrats themselves, and all of them have been supported by Democrats in the past, including a physical barrier, wall, or fence. Furthermore, in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform, there are two more elements to my plan.**

*Number one is three years of legislative relief for 700,000 DACA recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago. This extension will give them access to work permits, Social Security numbers, and protection from deportation, most importantly. Secondly, our proposal provides a three-year extension of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. This means that 300,000 immigrants whose protected status is facing expiration will now have three more years of certainty so that Congress can work on a larger immigration deal, which everybody wants -- Republicans and Democrats.**

*And our farmers and vineyards won’t be affected because lawful and regulated entry into our country will be easy and consistent. That is our plan: border security, DACA, TPS, and many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable, and common sense, with lots of compromise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to bring this bill to a vote this week in the United States Senate.**

*Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis -- and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government.**

*If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border [Broader] project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product -- a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem.**

*Whatever we do, I can promise you this: I will never forget that my first duty, and ultimate loyalty, is to you, the American people. Any reforms we make to our immigration system will be designed to improve your lives, make your communities safer, and make our nation more prosperous and secure for generations to come. Thank you and God bless America. Thank you.**

*Just a short time ago, I had the honor of presiding over the swearing-in of five new great American citizens. It was a beautiful ceremony and a moving reminder of our nation’s proud history of welcoming legal immigrants from all over the world into our national family. I told them that the beauty and majesty of citizenship is that it draws no distinctions of race, or class, or faith, or gender or background.**

*All Americans, whether first generation or tenth generation, are bound together in love and loyalty, friendship and affection. We are all equal. We are one team, and one people, proudly saluting one great American flag. We believe in a safe and lawful system of immigration, one that upholds our laws, our traditions, and our most cherished values.**

*Unfortunately, our immigration system has been badly broken for a very long time. Over the decades, many Presidents and many lawmakers have come and gone, and no real progress has been made on immigration. We are now living with the consequences -- and they are tragic -- brought about by decades of political stalemate, partisan gridlock, and national neglect.**

*There is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action. Thousands of children are being exploited by ruthless coyotes and vicious cartels and gangs. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted.**

*Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl.

*I am very proud to welcome tens of thousands of families, students, and people of all faiths and backgrounds to our nation's capital for the 46th annual March For Life. This is a movement founded on love and grounded in the nobility and dignity of every human life. When we look into the eyes of a newborn child, we see the beauty and the human soul and the majesty of God's creation.**

*We know that every life has meaning and that every life is worth protecting, As president, I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence -- the right to life. During my first week in office, I reinstated the Mexico City Policy. We have taken bold action to protect the religious freedoms for doctors, nurses, and charities like the Little Sisters Of The Poor We issued a new proposal to prohibit Title Ten taxpayer funding from going to any clinic that performs abortions.**

*We are supporting the loving choice of adoption and foster care, including through the support of faith-based adoption services. And I am supporting the U.S. Senate's effort to make permanent the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion in spending bills. Today I have signed a letter to Congress to make clear that if they send any legislation to my desk that weakens the protection of human life, I will issue a veto.**

*And we have the support to uphold those vetoes. Every child is a sacred gift from God. As this year's March For Life theme says, each person is unique from Day One. That is a very important phrase. Unique from Day One. And so true. I want to thank Americans who traveled all across the country to march for life, and I especially want to thank so many young people who give us hope for the future.**

*Together we will work to save the lives of unborn children, so they have a chance to live and to love, to thrive and to dream, and to bless our nation and reach their full and glorious potential. Thank you. God bless you and your families, and God bless America.**

*Wow, that's really nice. Thank you. You're only doing that because I gave you the greatest and biggest budget in our history. [Laughter] And I've now done it two times. [Applause] And I hate to tell the rest of the world, but I'm about to do it three times. So -- [Applause] -- so that's the only reason you gave me such a nice welcome.**

*Thank you very much. And thank you to Vice President Pence for that wonderful introduction. It's an honor to be at the Pentagon with so many distinguished military leaders, and I especially want to recognize our Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan. He's been fantastic -- wherever you may be, Patrick.**

*Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. We were talking just as I came on. I said, "Pat, I have to go now." We're talking defense and we're also talking offense, you know? We can't forget offense either, can we? We have the finest weapons in the world, and we're ordering the finest weapons in the world. That, you can be sure of. We're here to present the results of my administration's Missile Defense Review.**

*Our goal is simple: to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States -- anywhere, anytime, anyplace. As we all know, the best way to keep America safe is to keep America strong. And that's what we're doing. Stronger than ever. Joining us for today's presentation are great champions of missile defense in Congress: Senator Dan Sullivan, my friend.**

*Thank you, Dan, very much. And Representative Mike Turner. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Also joining us from the Department of Defense are Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist. David, thank you. Secretary Mark Esper. Secretary Heather Wilson. Thank you. Under Secretaries of Defense Michael Griffin, Ellen Lord, and John Rood.**

*General Paul Selva. Thank you. Thank you, General. General Mark Milley. Thank you, Mark. Thank you. Thank you. And congratulations. Very importantly, congratulations. General Joseph Lengyel. And General James McConville. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Before presenting the results of our Missile Defense Review, I want to take a moment to express my deepest condolences to the families of the brave American heroes who laid down their lives yesterday in selfless service to our nation.**

*These are great people. Great, great people. We will never forget their noble and immortal sacrifice. This morning, I also would like to briefly address another matter of critical national security: the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Without a strong border, America is defenseless, vulnerable, and unprotected.**

*I also want to thank the military for helping us out during the big caravan period. But now you have more caravans forming, and they're on their way up. Thousands and thousands of people. We don't know where they're from, who they are -- nothing. We need strong borders. We need strong barriers and walls.**

*Nothing else is going to work. Everyone knows it. Everybody is saying it now. It's just a question of time. This should have been done many years ago. It should have been done by other -- really, by other Presidents, and it wasn't, just like many of the other things we're doing that could have been done many years ago, whether it's our negotiations with North Korea, moving the embassy to Jerusalem.**

*So many things were supposed to have been done many years ago, and they weren't. But we're doing them. A wall has to be built. We need security at our southern border. Drugs flow in. Tremendous percentages of the drugs coming into our country come from the southern border. We're not going to allow it to happen.**

*And that is why our Homeland Security professionals have asked Congress for a steel barrier between the ports of entry; to fund more agents, beds, medical supplies, and technology; and to close the ridiculous and dangerous immigration loopholes that no country in the world has but us. The federal government remains shut down because Congressional Democrats refuse to approve border security.**

*We're going to have border security. It's going to be tight. It's going to be strong. We're going to let people into our country gladly, but they're going to come in legally. That includes for the farmers who need help and for others. But we are going to have powerful, strong border security. While many Democrats in the House and Senate would like to make a deal, Speaker Pelosi will not let them negotiate.**

*The Party has been hijacked by the open borders fringe within the Party. The radical left becoming the radical Democrats. Hopefully, Democrat lawmakers will step forward to do what is right for our country. And what's right for our country is border security at the strongest level. Stop human hijacking. Stop drugs.**

*Stop gangs. Stop criminals. That's what we're going to do. That was my pledge, and that's what we're going to do. We're gathered together to outline the steps that we must take to upgrade and modernize America's missile defense. So important. In a time of rapidly evolving threats, we must be certain that our defensive capabilities are unrivaled and unmatched anywhere in the world.**

*All over, foreign adversaries, competitors, and rogue regimes are steadily enhancing their missile arsenals. All over. Their arsenals are getting bigger and stronger. And we're getting bigger and stronger, in every way. They're increasing their lethal strike capabilities, and they're focused on developing long-range missiles that could reach targets within the United States.**

*As President, my first duty is the defense of our country. First duty: the defense of our country. And defense has many different definitions and covers a lot of territory. I will accept nothing less for our nation than the most effective, cutting-edge missile defense systems. We have the best anywhere in the world.**

*It's not even close. Our new strategy calls for six major changes in missile defense policy: First, we will prioritize the defense of the American people above all else. Our review calls for 20 new ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, and new radars and sensors to immediately detect foreign missiles launched against our great nation.**

*We are committed to establishing a missile defense program that can shield every city in the United States. And we will never negotiate away our right to do this. Second, we will focus on developing new technology, not just investing more money into existing systems. The world is changing, and we're going to change much faster than the rest of the world.**

*This past Tuesday, the Iranian regime tested a "space launch vehicle" -- which failed -- that will provide Iran with critical information -- if it didn't fail -- that they could use to pursue intercontinental ballistic missile capability, and a capability, actually, of reaching the United States. We're not going to have that happen.**

*The United States cannot simply build more of the same, or make only incremental improvements. What we've done to Iran since I've become President is rather miraculous. I ended the horrible, weak Iran Nuclear Deal. And I will tell you, Iran is a much different country today than it was two years ago. It's not the same and it won't be the same.**

*And I do believe they want to talk. It is not enough to merely keep pace with our adversaries; we must outpace them at every single turn. We must pursue the advanced technology and research to guarantee that the United States is always several steps ahead of those who would do us harm. Third, we will protect the American people from all types of missile attacks.**

*In the past, the United States lacked a comprehensive strategy for missile defense that extended beyond ballistic missiles. Under our plan, that will change. The U.S. will now adjust its posture to also defend against any missile strikes, including cruise and hypersonic missiles. And we are, by the way, very advanced also on hypersonic technology and missiles.**

*We will always be at the forefront of everything. Fourth, we will recognize that space is a new warfighting domain, with the Space Force leading the way. My upcoming budget will invest in a space-based missile defense layer. It's new technology. It's ultimately going to be a very, very big part of our defense and, obviously, of our offense.**

*The system will be monitored, and we will terminate any missile launches from hostile powers, or even from powers that make a mistake. It won't happen. Regardless of the missile type or the geographic origins of the attack, we will ensure that enemy missiles find no sanctuary on Earth or in the skies above.**

*This is the direction that I'm heading. We have some very bad players out there, and we're a good player but we can be far worse than anybody, if need be. I've always known -- and I've watched and I've seen -- the stronger you are, the less you will need, whatever that strength may be. Fifth, we will remove bureaucratic obstacles to dramatically speed up the acquisition and deployment of the new technology.**

*And sixth, we will insist on fair burden sharing with our allies. I've made it clear we are protecting many, many wealthy, wealthy, wealthy, wealthy countries. One country, they said, has an unsustainable cash flow. In other words, they make so much money they don't know what to do with it. I said, "Send it our way." [Laughter] "We're protecting you.**

*Send it our way." We protect all of these wealthy countries, which I'm very honored to do, but many of them are so wealthy they can easily pay us the cost of this protection. So you'll see big changes taking place. And we've had great talks with countries. Friendly talks. One of them said, "Mr. President, yes, we will work with you.**

*But for 30 years, nobody has ever asked." I said, "Now we're asking." It took a long time. I said, "Now we're asking." And that allows us to spend much more money than these incredible budgets, where it's just money going out and not coming back. So, wealthy, wealthy countries that we're protecting are all under notice and all cooperating very nicely.**

*I would say they probably liked other Presidents more than me, but that's okay. I don't blame them. I would too. [Laughter] There was a recent poll in Europe. The original poll, when I first ran, I was one of the most popular people in the world. And now they said, "He's not popular in Europe." I shouldn't be -- because I'm asking them to step up. You have countries paying less than 1 percent in NATO. Last year, I raised $44 billion more by saying, "I'm sorry, you have to step up." The year before that, my first year -- so I was just getting started -- I raised $24 billion with one meeting.**

*And until that, it was just going down. It was going down. For 15 years, it was just going down, the numbers going into NATO. And this year we'll also have a good year. They're starting to step up. Very unfair when Germany pays 1 percent and we're paying 4.3 percent of a much larger GDP. We cannot be the fools for others.**

*We cannot be. We don't want to be called that. And I will tell you, for many years, behind your backs, that's what they were saying. So there's a big difference. We're going to be with NATO 100 percent. But as I told the countries, you have to step up. You have to pay minimum numbers, actually. The numbers should be much higher.**

*They set a 2 percent goal. Very few pay that. But they should be much higher than that. If you look at what we pay, it's massively higher than that. So we have very good relationships, but countries are now stepping up, and they can well afford to. In furtherance of this goal, our plan directs the Department of Defense to prioritize the sale of American missile defense and technology to our allies and to our partners.**

*We want them to be able to defend. And they're willing to pay for the finest missiles in the world. They've already done that. They're stepping up like nobody has ever seen before, actually. We will also leverage our network of partnerships to share early warning and tracking information, and detect missile launches as early as possible.**

*Today marks the beginning of a new era in our missile defense program. For too long, we have been held back by self-imposed limits while foreign competitors grow and they advance more than we have over the years. Part of the reason is we spend so much money on so many other places. Now that's changing. We're helping and we're able to spend money on technology and new defense, and far beyond defense systems.**

*So those days are history. Our strategy is grounded in one overriding objective: to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any American target, whether before or after launch. When it comes to defending America, we will not take any chances. We will only take action. There is no substitute for American military might.**

*But when I took office -- you know it better than anybody in the world -- our military was very tired. It was very depleted. I won't even tell you the things that some of our great generals were telling me. And now it's being rebuilt at a rapid rate and, very shortly, will be more powerful than ever before.**

*And that's the way it has to be. And as I said, the more powerful it is, the less likely it is that we'll ever have to use it. But it will soon be more powerful than ever before. Today, we reaffirm that a strong America remains the best way to prevent conflict, promote peace, preserve freedom, and protect our great people.**

*Together, we unite behind a noble mission: to shield our country with the greatest missile defense systems anywhere on the face of the Earth. I want to thank you again to the men and women of the American Armed Forces. Special, special people. And the citizens of our country know that and acknowledge that, far more so than you would ever know.**

*We have the greatest military at any time soon in the history of the world. I want to just finish my saying I appreciate your service. You're incredible people. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]**

It's an honor to be at the Pentagon with so many distinguished military leaders, and I especially want to recognize our Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan. He's been fantastic -- wherever you may be, Patrick.**

*Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. We were talking just as I came on. I said, "Pat, I have to go now." We're talking defense and we're also talking offense, you know? We can't forget offense either, can we? We have the finest weapons in the world, and we're ordering the finest weapons in the world. That, you can be sure of. We're here to present the results of my administration's Missile Defense Review.**

*Our goal is simple: to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States -- anywhere, anytime, anyplace. As we all know, the best way to keep America safe is to keep America strong. And that's what we're doing. Stronger than ever. Joining us for today's presentation are great champions of missile defense in Congress: Senator Dan Sullivan, my friend.**

*Thank you, Dan, very much. And Representative Mike Turner. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Also joining us from the Department of Defense are Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist. David, thank you. Secretary Mark Esper. Secretary Heather Wilson. Thank you. Under Secretaries of Defense Michael Griffin, Ellen Lord, and John Rood.**

*General Paul Selva. Thank you. Thank you, General. General Mark Milley. Thank you, Mark. Thank you. Thank you. And congratulations. Very importantly, congratulations. General Joseph Lengyel. And General James McConville. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Before presenting the results of our Missile Defense Review, I want to take a moment to express my deepest condolences to the families of the brave American heroes who laid down their lives yesterday in selfless service to our nation.**

*These are great people. Great, great people. We will never forget their noble and immortal sacrifice. This morning, I also would like to briefly address another matter of critical national security: the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Without a strong border, America is defenseless, vulnerable, and unprotected.**

*I also want to thank the military for helping us out during the big caravan period. But now you have more caravans forming, and they're on their way up. Thousands and thousands of people. We don't know where they're from, who they are -- nothing. We need strong borders. We need strong barriers and walls.**

*Nothing else is going to work. Everyone knows it. Everybody is saying it now. It's just a question of time. This should have been done many years ago. It should have been done by other -- really, by other Presidents, and it wasn't, just like many of the other things we're doing that could have been done many years ago, whether it's our negotiations with North Korea, moving the embassy to Jerusalem.**

*So many things were supposed to have been done many years ago, and they weren't. But we're doing them. A wall has to be built. We need security at our southern border. Drugs flow in. Tremendous percentages of the drugs coming into our country come from the southern border. We're not going to allow it to happen.**

*And that is why our Homeland Security professionals have asked Congress for a steel barrier between the ports of entry; to fund more agents, beds, medical supplies, and technology; and to close the ridiculous and dangerous immigration loopholes that no country in the world has but us. The federal government remains shut down because Congressional Democrats refuse to approve border security.**

*We're going to have border security. It's going to be tight. It's going to be strong. We're going to let people into our country gladly, but they're going to come in legally. That includes for the farmers who need help and for others. But we are going to have powerful, strong border security. While many Democrats in the House and Senate would like to make a deal, Speaker Pelosi will not let them negotiate.**

*The Party has been hijacked by the open borders fringe within the Party. The radical left becoming the radical Democrats. Hopefully, Democrat lawmakers will step forward to do what is right for our country. And what's right for our country is border security at the strongest level. Stop human hijacking. Stop drugs.**

*Stop gangs. Stop criminals. That's what we're going to do. That was my pledge, and that's what we're going to do. We're gathered together to outline the steps that we must take to upgrade and modernize America's missile defense. So important. In a time of rapidly evolving threats, we must be certain that our defensive capabilities are unrivaled and unmatched anywhere in the world.**

*All over, foreign adversaries, competitors, and rogue regimes are steadily enhancing their missile arsenals. All over. Their arsenals are getting bigger and stronger. And we're getting bigger and stronger, in every way. They're increasing their lethal strike capabilities, and they're focused on developing long-range missiles that could reach targets within the United States.**

*As President, my first duty is the defense of our country. First duty: the defense of our country. And defense has many different definitions and covers a lot of territory. I will accept nothing less for our nation than the most effective, cutting-edge missile defense systems. We have the best anywhere in the world.**

*It's not even close. Our new strategy calls for six major changes in missile defense policy: First, we will prioritize the defense of the American people above all else. Our review calls for 20 new ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, and new radars and sensors to immediately detect foreign missiles launched against our great nation.**

*We are committed to establishing a missile defense program that can shield every city in the United States. And we will never negotiate away our right to do this. Second, we will focus on developing new technology, not just investing more money into existing systems. The world is changing, and we're going to change much faster than the rest of the world.**

*This past Tuesday, the Iranian regime tested a "space launch vehicle" -- which failed -- that will provide Iran with critical information -- if it didn't fail -- that they could use to pursue intercontinental ballistic missile capability, and a capability, actually, of reaching the United States. We're not going to have that happen.**

*The United States cannot simply build more of the same, or make only incremental improvements. What we've done to Iran since I've become President is rather miraculous. I ended the horrible, weak Iran Nuclear Deal. And I will tell you, Iran is a much different country today than it was two years ago. It's not the same and it won't be the same.**

*And I do believe they want to talk. It is not enough to merely keep pace with our adversaries; we must outpace them at every single turn. We must pursue the advanced technology and research to guarantee that the United States is always several steps ahead of those who would do us harm. Third, we will protect the American people from all types of missile attacks.**

*In the past, the United States lacked a comprehensive strategy for missile defense that extended beyond ballistic missiles. Under our plan, that will change. The U.S. will now adjust its posture to also defend against any missile strikes, including cruise and hypersonic missiles. And we are, by the way, very advanced also on hypersonic technology and missiles.**

*We will always be at the forefront of everything. Fourth, we will recognize that space is a new warfighting domain, with the Space Force leading the way. My upcoming budget will invest in a space-based missile defense layer. It's new technology. It's ultimately going to be a very, very big part of our defense and, obviously, of our offense.**

*The system will be monitored, and we will terminate any missile launches from hostile powers, or even from powers that make a mistake. It won't happen. Regardless of the missile type or the geographic origins of the attack, we will ensure that enemy missiles find no sanctuary on Earth or in the skies above.**

*This is the direction that I'm heading. We have some very bad players out there, and we're a good player but we can be far worse than anybody, if need be. I've always known -- and I've watched and I've seen -- the stronger you are, the less you will need, whatever that strength may be. Fifth, we will remove bureaucratic obstacles to dramatically speed up the acquisition and deployment of the new technology.**

*And sixth, we will insist on fair burden sharing with our allies. I've made it clear we are protecting many, many wealthy, wealthy, wealthy, wealthy countries. One country, they said, has an unsustainable cash flow. In other words, they make so much money they don't know what to do with it. I said, "Send it our way." [Laughter] "We're protecting you.**

*Send it our way." We protect all of these wealthy countries, which I'm very honored to do, but many of them are so wealthy they can easily pay us the cost of this protection. So you'll see big changes taking place. And we've had great talks with countries. Friendly talks. One of them said, "Mr. President, yes, we will work with you.**

*But for 30 years, nobody has ever asked." I said, "Now we're asking." It took a long time. I said, "Now we're asking." And that allows us to spend much more money than these incredible budgets, where it's just money going out and not coming back. So, wealthy, wealthy countries that we're protecting are all under notice and all cooperating very nicely.**

*I would say they probably liked other Presidents more than me, but that's okay. I don't blame them. I would too. [Laughter] There was a recent poll in Europe. The original poll, when I first ran, I was one of the most popular people in the world. And now they said, "He's not popular in Europe." I shouldn't be -- because I'm asking them to step up. You have countries paying less than 1 percent in NATO. Last year, I raised $44 billion more by saying, "I'm sorry, you have to step up." The year before that, my first year -- so I was just getting started -- I raised $24 billion with one meeting.**

*And until that, it was just going down. It was going down. For 15 years, it was just going down, the numbers going into NATO. And this year we'll also have a good year. They're starting to step up. Very unfair when Germany pays 1 percent and we're paying 4.3 percent of a much larger GDP. We cannot be the fools for others.**

*We cannot be. We don't want to be called that. And I will tell you, for many years, behind your backs, that's what they were saying. So there's a big difference. We're going to be with NATO 100 percent. But as I told the countries, you have to step up. You have to pay minimum numbers, actually. The numbers should be much higher.**

*They set a 2 percent goal. Very few pay that. But they should be much higher than that. If you look at what we pay, it's massively higher than that. So we have very good relationships, but countries are now stepping up, and they can well afford to. In furtherance of this goal, our plan directs the Department of Defense to prioritize the sale of American missile defense and technology to our allies and to our partners.**

*We want them to be able to defend. And they're willing to pay for the finest missiles in the world. They've already done that. They're stepping up like nobody has ever seen before, actually. We will also leverage our network of partnerships to share early warning and tracking information, and detect missile launches as early as possible.**

*Today marks the beginning of a new era in our missile defense program. For too long, we have been held back by self-imposed limits while foreign competitors grow and they advance more than we have over the years. Part of the reason is we spend so much money on so many other places. Now that's changing. We're helping and we're able to spend money on technology and new defense, and far beyond defense systems.**

*So those days are history. Our strategy is grounded in one overriding objective: to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any American target, whether before or after launch. When it comes to defending America, we will not take any chances. We will only take action. There is no substitute for American military might.**

*But when I took office -- you know it better than anybody in the world -- our military was very tired. It was very depleted. I won't even tell you the things that some of our great generals were telling me. And now it's being rebuilt at a rapid rate and, very shortly, will be more powerful than ever before.**

*And that's the way it has to be. And as I said, the more powerful it is, the less likely it is that we'll ever have to use it. But it will soon be more powerful than ever before. Today, we reaffirm that a strong America remains the best way to prevent conflict, promote peace, preserve freedom, and protect our great people.**

*Together, we unite behind a noble mission: to shield our country with the greatest missile defense systems anywhere on the face of the Earth. I want to thank you again to the men and women of the American Armed Forces. Special, special people. And the citizens of our country know that and acknowledge that, far more so than you would ever know.**

*We have the greatest military at any time soon in the history of the world. I want to just finish my saying I appreciate your service. You're incredible people. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]**

*That's such a great song. We should just let it play, right? [Laughter] We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific -- a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records.**

*We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately.**

*We got to plant. But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen.**

*So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. [Applause] You know, it's -- I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, Eh, I don't want to talk about that. [Laughter] But you have to say, Drew Brees -- he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game.**

*And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. [Applause] It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with -- and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people -- for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation -- 100 exactly.**

*If it was 99 -- although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval.**

*Where's Zippy? Zippy. [Applause] Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. [Laughter] Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation.**

*So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. [Applause] Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor -- he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that -- he's really helped us out in so many different ways.**

*And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. [Applause] Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory -- she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well.**

*You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. [Applause] A brilliant guy -- he's very deceiving. My wife said, I love watching him on television. And I said, Who? John Kennedy. I said, John Kennedy? I don't know. But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy.**

*She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very -- I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford -- you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state.**

*He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked -- and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar -- an airport hangar. I said, You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win. And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy.**

*Thank you, John. [Applause] Oxford. Oxford John. [Laughs] Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? [Applause] Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. [Applause] We got a lot of good politicians down here.**

*And the legend from Louisiana -- a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. [Applause] He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting.**

*He -- I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down.**

*I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest.**

*In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left -- that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash -- ground ball -- hit at Steve.**

*And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, Oh, that's going right to second base. It went right in him -- right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. [Laughter and applause] Who could have done that but my Steve, right?**

*[Applause] That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise -- what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.**

*It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing -- And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations. You know why? Because everybody stayed standing.**

*[Laughter] Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. [Applause] That's true. [Applause] That's true. [Laughs] [Applause] That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing -- I go home, I say, Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something. [Laughter] North Korea, China.**

*We're doing great in the trade deal. China -- this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand. [Laughter] The other way, they'll say, The crowd did not appreciate him.**

*They didn't give him one standing ovation. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes -- who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago.**

*You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world -- this is a world problem -- than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children -- the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape.**

*They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls.**

*And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. [Applause] One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, You didn't build wall. I said, I built wall. So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see.**

*But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build -- what we have to build -- probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations.**

*And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous -- Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard.**

*Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that.**

*Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border -- and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals -- including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic -- it's an epidemic -- heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week.**

*And 90 percent of it -- at least -- crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE -- incredible people -- and they show me the methods that they use -- how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines.**

*They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared -- you'll make the money back numerous times a year.**

*In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens -- think of that -- with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings.**

*The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans -- threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.**

*They have to come in through a process. [Applause] Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down.**

*I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall -- again, we've already done a lot of work -- but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good.**

*This is the reason why they don't want the wall built -- because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall.**

*And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at -- [Applause] -- I got you the biggest tax cut -- beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country -- and we're going further. [Applause] That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well.**

*But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I -- I said, We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to do… And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the -- that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that He's actually done more than he promised. It's true.**

*I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. [Applause] A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years -- decades and decades. And we got Accountability -- VA Accountability.**

*When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them -- whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them.**

*And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that -- too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans. [Applause] That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative.**

*It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on -- you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers -- they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country.**

*We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra -- we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, We like technology. I like technology, too.**

*But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week -- and we have no idea who they are. And you got some -- I'm sure -- very good ones, but you got some real bad ones.**

*Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera.**

*Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers. [Applause] Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. [Applause] I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this.**

*You need those -- you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen.**

*But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now.**

*So just remember that. [Applause] I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall -- these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people -- or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically.**

*In El Paso, they had -- it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight. Does that tell you something? [Applause] And I can give you many examples of that.**

*They say it's medieval -- a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say a wheel. But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. [Laughter] Wheels work and walls work.**

*You know, there's some things you can't beat. [Applause] That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength.**

*We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- El Salvador, Honduras, and other places -- Guatemala -- hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations.**

*We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came -- we're looking at a whole plan -- why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities?**

*Why are we sending them money? [Applause] A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes -- changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better.**

*As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money.**

*Well, you make it back every month -- probably more than that -- because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. [Applause] So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds.**

*Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries -- I say one, because every time I say something else they'll say, Oh, well, there was a country that also did it. Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, catch. We then take their names and we bring them to a court -- can you believe this?**

*-- and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold. Catch-and-not-release. But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce -- these are the laws -- then you say, Come back in three years for your trial. Tell me, what percentage of people come back?**

*Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? [Laughter] And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. [Laughter] Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you.**

*[Laughter and applause] Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy -- a radical Islamic terrorist in New York -- area I know very well -- driving down the West Side highway.**

*Beautiful -- Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all -- some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. [Laughter] Some of my friends over there. Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog.**

*[Laughter] But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep -- and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn. Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream.**

*And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is -- they say, Oh, well, 12 were injured. You know, like, injured -- you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured.**

*And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in -- chain migration. In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one -- the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery.**

*Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful. Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans.**

*You know, maybe they voted -- who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are -- these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration.**

*Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice.**

*And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. [Applause] Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly -- very deadly -- Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch.**

*Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. [Applause] Sorry about that, Jim. [Laughs] I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all.**

*But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone.**

*Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's -- and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing. They don't even think about it. They don't even think.**

*They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return. I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Mr. President, we need a wall. [Applause] I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. [Applause]**

*In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? [Applause]**

*Thank you, Jim. [Applause] Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries.**

*When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, That's a strange statement. They said, No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico. And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries.**

*And many of them were from other countries, including China -- countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that -- you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe -- the Democrats.**

*We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend.**

*They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents. [Applause]**

*Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China -- we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown.**

*We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms -- a big amount -- they said, Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance.**

*Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent. You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. [Applause] So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government.**

*Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada -- the way you were treated.**

*Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody.**

*We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others -- small business -- it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents -- you love your parents -- they're farmers -- they love their farms.**

*Everybody loves their farm. The kids -- they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax.**

*We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? [Laughter] Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one? Okay, you don't want to say.**

*That's all right. [Laughter] That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. [Laughter] They said, We don't want to talk about it. Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. [Applause] And everybody is trying -- they're still trying to figure out what happened.**

*We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round -- all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. [Applause] Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst -- your senators -- a lot of great people were very strong on that.**

*And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. [Applause] I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?**

*I don't think so. I don't think so. [Laughter and applause] I'm in the Beast -- the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, Fellas, slow up. I can't see. [Laughter] They say, $1.75. That didn't happen by accident, folks.**

*That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion.**

*Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, Oh, gee, how are we doing? It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill.**

*We got it done. That wasn't easy either. [Applause] That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. [Applause] That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill.**

*So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses.**

*It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. [Applause] That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now.**

*You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit.**

*You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad. [Applause] I said, Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay. [Laughter] It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone.**

*Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history.**

*The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule.**

*[Applause] Disaster -- other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, John, I'm going to get killed for this one. Because what we did was take something -- the Water of the United States. How beautiful is that?**

*And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you -- and other businesses, by the way. [Applause] And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come -- and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people.**

*They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, What are you crying about? The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life.**

*I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. [Laughter] He said, Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing. In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val -- [Applause]. [Laughs] It's a good place.**

*[Laughter] You have a great new senator, by the way. [Applause] A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the prairie potholes on their land.**

*Do you all know what prairie potholes are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. [Laughter] To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your -- out of your tanks -- your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.**

*You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake. [Applause] And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. [Applause] We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products.**

*We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations -- it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion -- not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right.**

*They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the -- they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right?**

*The European Union. And then the press gets angry. They say, Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly. Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, They should be. [Laughter] No, seriously.**

*They said, When he started off, he had 87 percent. That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they [Inaudible] because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country -- you know, one of those [Inaudible]. [Applause] True. It's true. They said, His poll numbers have tanked. And I said, Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it. And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe.**

*That's okay. [Laughter] No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China -- $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [Billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right?**

*[Laughter] But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi -- who's a friend of -- great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, Boy, this is -- this could be dangerous. [Laughter] I'm in China.**

*I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, I don't like this. But I looked at him, and I realized -- actually during that speech -- it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. [Applause] Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world.**

*You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive -- they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, You got to start ordering. You're going to order. They're going to order, and they've already started.**

*We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. [Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, You have to open it up to pork. And they said, Okay. I said, Why didn't you do it before? They said, Nobody ever asked us. [Laughter] A lot of it is that.**

*You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho -- [Applause] -- and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them.**

*We said, You got to open up. Sorry. U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? [Applause] And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much.**

*But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken -- [Applause]. You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is -- that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers.**

*This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is -- with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers -- removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers.**

*We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA. A whole different world. A whole different world. [Applause] NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country.**

*As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. [Applause] Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, What can we do? They said that would be a big thing -- on wheat.**

*Even the NFL -- you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, You got to treat the NFL fairly. You know, it's a great American company.**

*And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right. Any company -- I don't care, but that was the NFL.**

*A big company. A great American company. I said, You're not treating them well. We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years.**

*Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state -- I love this state. Remember when they say, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long.**

*Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, Donald Trump… Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. [Applause] We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows.**

*Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years.**

*They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about -- it's almost -- no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one -- I think it's going to be very tough for them not.**

*But I think that -- I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election.**

*Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come. More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase.**

*No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth.**

*And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. [Applause] Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. [Applause] From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee -- [Applause]; from the plains of Missouri -- [Applause] -- to the Big Sky of Montana -- [Applause]; and from the marshes of Florida -- [Applause] -- to the fertile valley of California -- [Applause] -- farmers have always led the way.**

*[Applause] The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. [Applause] You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love.**

*Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. [Applause] Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for.**

*[Applause] We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land.**

*We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution. And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before.**

*I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do.**

*I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [Applause]**

*That's such a great song. We should just let it play, right? [Laughter] We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific -- a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records.**

*We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately.**

*We got to plant. But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen.**

*So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. [Applause] You know, it's -- I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, Eh, I don't want to talk about that. [Laughter] But you have to say, Drew Brees -- he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game.**

*And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. [Applause] It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with -- and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people -- for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation -- 100 exactly.**

*If it was 99 -- although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval.**

*Where's Zippy? Zippy. [Applause] Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. [Laughter] Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation.**

*So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. [Applause] Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor -- he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that -- he's really helped us out in so many different ways.**

*And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. [Applause] Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory -- she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well.**

*You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. [Applause] A brilliant guy -- he's very deceiving. My wife said, I love watching him on television. And I said, Who? John Kennedy. I said, John Kennedy? I don't know. But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy.**

*She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very -- I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford -- you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state.**

*He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked -- and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar -- an airport hangar. I said, You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win. And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy.**

*Thank you, John. [Applause] Oxford. Oxford John. [Laughs] Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? [Applause] Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. [Applause] We got a lot of good politicians down here.**

*And the legend from Louisiana -- a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. [Applause] He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting.**

*He -- I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down.**

*I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest.**

*In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left -- that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash -- ground ball -- hit at Steve.**

*And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, Oh, that's going right to second base. It went right in him -- right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. [Laughter and applause] Who could have done that but my Steve, right?**

*[Applause] That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise -- what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.**

*It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing -- And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations. You know why? Because everybody stayed standing.**

*[Laughter] Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. [Applause] That's true. [Applause] That's true. [Laughs] [Applause] That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing -- I go home, I say, Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something. [Laughter] North Korea, China.**

*We're doing great in the trade deal. China -- this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand. [Laughter] The other way, they'll say, The crowd did not appreciate him.**

*They didn't give him one standing ovation. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes -- who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago.**

*You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world -- this is a world problem -- than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children -- the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape.**

*They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls.**

*And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. [Applause] One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, You didn't build wall. I said, I built wall. So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see.**

*But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build -- what we have to build -- probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations.**

*And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous -- Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard.**

*Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that.**

*Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border -- and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals -- including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic -- it's an epidemic -- heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week.**

*And 90 percent of it -- at least -- crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE -- incredible people -- and they show me the methods that they use -- how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines.**

*They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared -- you'll make the money back numerous times a year.**

*In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens -- think of that -- with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings.**

*The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans -- threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.**

*They have to come in through a process. [Applause] Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down.**

*I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall -- again, we've already done a lot of work -- but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good.**

*This is the reason why they don't want the wall built -- because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall.**

*And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at -- [Applause] -- I got you the biggest tax cut -- beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country -- and we're going further. [Applause] That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well.**

*But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I -- I said, We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to do… And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the -- that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that He's actually done more than he promised. It's true.**

*I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. [Applause] A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years -- decades and decades. And we got Accountability -- VA Accountability.**

*When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them -- whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them.**

*And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that -- too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans. [Applause] That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative.**

*It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on -- you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers -- they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country.**

*We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra -- we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, We like technology. I like technology, too.**

*But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week -- and we have no idea who they are. And you got some -- I'm sure -- very good ones, but you got some real bad ones.**

*Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera.**

*Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers. [Applause] Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. [Applause] I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this.**

*You need those -- you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen.**

*But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now.**

*So just remember that. [Applause] I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall -- these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people -- or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically.**

*In El Paso, they had -- it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight. Does that tell you something? [Applause] And I can give you many examples of that.**

*They say it's medieval -- a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say a wheel. But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. [Laughter] Wheels work and walls work.**

*You know, there's some things you can't beat. [Applause] That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength.**

*We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- El Salvador, Honduras, and other places -- Guatemala -- hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations.**

*We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came -- we're looking at a whole plan -- why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities?**

*Why are we sending them money? [Applause] A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes -- changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better.**

*As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money.**

*Well, you make it back every month -- probably more than that -- because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. [Applause] So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds.**

*Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries -- I say one, because every time I say something else they'll say, Oh, well, there was a country that also did it. Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, catch. We then take their names and we bring them to a court -- can you believe this?**

*-- and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold. Catch-and-not-release. But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce -- these are the laws -- then you say, Come back in three years for your trial. Tell me, what percentage of people come back?**

*Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? [Laughter] And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. [Laughter] Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you.**

*[Laughter and applause] Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy -- a radical Islamic terrorist in New York -- area I know very well -- driving down the West Side highway.**

*Beautiful -- Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all -- some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. [Laughter] Some of my friends over there. Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog.**

*[Laughter] But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep -- and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn. Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream.**

*And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is -- they say, Oh, well, 12 were injured. You know, like, injured -- you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured.**

*And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in -- chain migration. In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one -- the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery.**

*Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful. Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans.**

*You know, maybe they voted -- who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are -- these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration.**

*Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice.**

*And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. [Applause] Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly -- very deadly -- Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch.**

*Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. [Applause] Sorry about that, Jim. [Laughs] I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all.**

*But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone.**

*Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's -- and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing. They don't even think about it. They don't even think.**

*They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return. I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Mr. President, we need a wall. [Applause] I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. [Applause]**

*In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? [Applause]**

*Thank you, Jim. [Applause] Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries.**

*When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, That's a strange statement. They said, No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico. And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries.**

*And many of them were from other countries, including China -- countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that -- you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe -- the Democrats.**

*We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend.**

*They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents. [Applause]**

*Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China -- we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown.**

*We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms -- a big amount -- they said, Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance.**

*Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent. You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. [Applause] So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government.**

*Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada -- the way you were treated.**

*Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody.**

*We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others -- small business -- it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents -- you love your parents -- they're farmers -- they love their farms.**

*Everybody loves their farm. The kids -- they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax.**

*We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? [Laughter] Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one? Okay, you don't want to say.**

*That's all right. [Laughter] That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. [Laughter] They said, We don't want to talk about it. Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. [Applause] And everybody is trying -- they're still trying to figure out what happened.**

*We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round -- all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. [Applause] Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst -- your senators -- a lot of great people were very strong on that.**

*And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. [Applause] I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?**

*I don't think so. I don't think so. [Laughter and applause] I'm in the Beast -- the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, Fellas, slow up. I can't see. [Laughter] They say, $1.75. That didn't happen by accident, folks.**

*That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion.**

*Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, Oh, gee, how are we doing? It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill.**

*We got it done. That wasn't easy either. [Applause] That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. [Applause] That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill.**

*So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses.**

*It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. [Applause] That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now.**

*You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit.**

*You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad. [Applause] I said, Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay. [Laughter] It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone.**

*Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history.**

*The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule.**

*[Applause] Disaster -- other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, John, I'm going to get killed for this one. Because what we did was take something -- the Water of the United States. How beautiful is that?**

*And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you -- and other businesses, by the way. [Applause] And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come -- and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people.**

*They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, What are you crying about? The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life.**

*I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. [Laughter] He said, Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing. In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val -- [Applause]. [Laughs] It's a good place.**

*[Laughter] You have a great new senator, by the way. [Applause] A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the prairie potholes on their land.**

*Do you all know what prairie potholes are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. [Laughter] To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your -- out of your tanks -- your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.**

*You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake. [Applause] And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. [Applause] We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products.**

*We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations -- it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion -- not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right.**

*They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the -- they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right?**

*The European Union. And then the press gets angry. They say, Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly. Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, They should be. [Laughter] No, seriously.**

*They said, When he started off, he had 87 percent. That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they [Inaudible] because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country -- you know, one of those [Inaudible]. [Applause] True. It's true. They said, His poll numbers have tanked. And I said, Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it. And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe.**

*That's okay. [Laughter] No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China -- $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [Billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right?**

*[Laughter] But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi -- who's a friend of -- great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, Boy, this is -- this could be dangerous. [Laughter] I'm in China.**

*I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, I don't like this. But I looked at him, and I realized -- actually during that speech -- it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. [Applause] Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world.**

*You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive -- they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, You got to start ordering. You're going to order. They're going to order, and they've already started.**

*We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. [Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, You have to open it up to pork. And they said, Okay. I said, Why didn't you do it before? They said, Nobody ever asked us. [Laughter] A lot of it is that.**

*You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho -- [Applause] -- and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them.**

*We said, You got to open up. Sorry. U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? [Applause] And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much.**

*But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken -- [Applause]. You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is -- that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers.**

*This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is -- with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers -- removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers.**

*We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA. A whole different world. A whole different world. [Applause] NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country.**

*As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. [Applause] Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, What can we do? They said that would be a big thing -- on wheat.**

*Even the NFL -- you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, You got to treat the NFL fairly. You know, it's a great American company.**

*And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right. Any company -- I don't care, but that was the NFL.**

*A big company. A great American company. I said, You're not treating them well. We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years.**

*Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state -- I love this state. Remember when they say, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long.**

*Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, Donald Trump… Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. [Applause] We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows.**

*Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years.**

*They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about -- it's almost -- no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one -- I think it's going to be very tough for them not.**

*But I think that -- I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election.**

*Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come. More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase.**

*No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth.**

*And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. [Applause] Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. [Applause] From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee -- [Applause]; from the plains of Missouri -- [Applause] -- to the Big Sky of Montana -- [Applause]; and from the marshes of Florida -- [Applause] -- to the fertile valley of California -- [Applause] -- farmers have always led the way.**

*[Applause] The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. [Applause] You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love.**

*Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. [Applause] Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for.**

*[Applause] We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land.**

*We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution. And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before.**

*I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do.**

*I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Good morning. Beautiful -- it's beautiful. It's too bad they took the snow off the ground. It's too bad. It was more beautiful last night.**

*[Inaudible] plans to meet with Democrats?**

*I'll be going to New Orleans right now. I'm going to be speaking in front of our great farmers. I look forward to that. I did it last year, and I look forward to it. So we'll be back a little bit later. I believe -- I don't know if the weather changes things, but the Clemson championship team, the national championship team, will be coming tonight.**

*It'll be exciting. A very great team. An unbelievable team. They'll be coming tonight. And I think we're going to serve McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King, with some pizza. I really mean it. It'll be interesting. And I would think that's their favorite food. So we'll see what happens. But they're coming tonight -- the national champions -- subject to the weather.**

*[Inaudible] shutdown? When are you going to talk to Democrats?**

*So I've been here all weekend. A lot of the Democrats were in Puerto Rico, celebrating something. I don't know, maybe they're celebrating the shutdown. We have a very big crisis -- a humanitarian crisis -- on the border. Everybody knows it. They know it. And many of them are saying, "We agree with you." Many of them are calling, and many of them are breaking.**

*The Republicans are rock solid. We've got to take care of our border. Many of the people -- they're all going to get their money. Many of the people that aren't being paid right now are in total agreement with us. You saw the Border Patrol agents. You saw what was happening. They're in total agreement with us. So we'll see how it all goes.**

*I will tell you this: We have a priority. It's the safety of our nation. The southern border has been horrible for decades, and it's now -- because of the success of our country, it's now at a level that we cannot put up with. The Democrats have to do something. We need their votes. Otherwise, we can't solve it without their votes.**

*They now control the House. Let's see if they can lead. I don't know that they can lead, but we're going to soon find out.**

*Did you hear about Senator Lindsey Graham's suggestion that you reopen temporarily?**

*What did you say?**

*Lindsey Graham suggested that you reopen the government temporarily while you continue to negotiate.**

*Well, that was a suggestion that Lindsey made. But I did -- I did reject it, yes. I'm not interested. I want to get it solved. I don't want to just delay it. I want to get it solved.**

*[Inaudible] you willing to share the interpreter's notes from your meetings with Vladimir Putin?**

*I just don't know anything about it. I read it this morning; it's a lot of fake news. That was a very good meeting. It was actually a very successful meeting. And I have those meetings with everything. I just know nothing about it. It was a -- a very, very successful meeting. We talked about Israel. We talked about the pipeline, that Germany is paying Russia a lot of money; I don't think it's appropriate, and we talked about that.**

*We talked about many subjects. But I have those meetings, one on one, with all leaders, including the President of China, including Prime Minister of Japan Abe. We have those meetings all the time. No big deal.**

*[Inaudible] have you ever worked for Russia?**

*I never worked for Russia, and you know that answer better than anybody. I never worked for Russia. Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big, fat hoax. It's just a hoax.**

*Mr. President, what about Steve King's remarks on white supremacy?**

*Who?**

*Steve King. Congressman Steve King. He said white supremacy --**

*I don't -- I haven't been following it. I really haven't been following it.**

*Mr. President, Kellyanne Conway said in a gaggle [Inaudible] you are close on a deal. Do you agree with Kellyanne that you think that you're close on a deal?**

*A deal with what?**

*In terms of ending the shutdown.**

*I don't know if we're close on a deal. This should be the easiest deal that I've ever seen. We're talking about border security. Who could be against it? We're talking about drugs pouring in -- human traffickers tying up women, putting tape on their mouth, and pouring into our country. We can't have that.**

*We can't have that. We have drugs, we have criminals, we have gangs, and the Democrats don't want to do anything about it. They say, "Oh, it's immoral." But it wasn’t immoral three years ago, five years ago, six years ago, and ten years ago, when they all raised their hands to approve a wall. All of the sudden, it's immoral.**

*It's immoral because -- one reason. Because they know they're going to lose in the 2020 election. That's the only reason, to them, it's immoral.**

*Mr. President, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has called you a "racist."**

*Who did?**

*Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.**

*Who cares. She's --**

*Mr. President, what was your take from last week's talks with China about trade?**

*We're doing very well with China. They're having a hard time with their economy because of the tariffs. We're doing very well with our economy. We're at records -- our unemployment numbers just hit a record, another record. We're doing extremely well, as a country. We're doing better than any country right now, anywhere in the world.**

*China wants to negotiate. I have a great relationship with President Xi because it's good to have relationships with Russia, and China, and Japan, and India. And I have relationships with almost everybody, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. I think that we are going to be able to do a deal with China.**

*We are -- I can tell you, we are getting things that, before I became President, you would have had no chance of getting. They would have laughed at your President's face.**

*[Inaudible]**

*The people that started that investigation are McCabe, who's a proven liar and was fired from the FBI; or Lisa Page, who was forced to leave the FBI, and her lover, Peter Stzrok, who -- we got their text messages, and what they said in those text messages was shocking, when you talk about bias. And also Comey.**

*And I guess they started it because I fired Comey, which was a great thing I did for our country. So the people doing that investigation were people that have been caught that are known scoundrels. They're, in many -- I guess you could say they're "dirty cops." And I'll tell you what, it is so unfair what's happened to the FBI, in terms of the men and women working in the rank and file of the FBI. I know many of them.**

*These are great people, and they are so embarrassed by their leadership. You've never seen -- I have never seen a turnaround in a bureau or agency like I have with the FBI. They are so embarrassed. I think 12 people now have been terminated. And others -- if you look at what's happening, others are going to go. What happened at the FBI -- So when you say, "Should I have confidence in the FBI or intelligence agencies?" When I see Ohr and I see all of these people; when I see Lisa and her lover, and their notes and their texts get captured, and you see what they said about me, having nothing to do with the investigation.**

*Let me tell you something, when people see that, you have an angry country because the whole thing is a hoax. It's a big hoax, and it's very bad for our country. So what happened with the FBI -- I have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey because he was a bad cop, and he was a dirty cop, and he lied.**

*He really lied. And all you have to do --**

*[Crosstalk]**

*Wait a minute. And all you have to do is take a look at the crooked Hillary Clinton investigation, where they brought her on the July 4th weekend -- July 4th. They didn't swear her in. They didn't do any tapes. They didn't do anything. They just let her go. And she usually said, mostly said, "I don't know." She didn't know anything.**

*Just like James Comey, a week ago. He was interviewed by Congress. And, you know, unfortunately, people didn't see it because the Republicans, with Paul Ryan, unfortunately, they didn't put him out there. But what he said was -- either he's a bad liar or he's grossly incompetent. Unfortunately, people didn't see it, but you can read the transcript.**

*[Inaudible]**

*What?**

*Do you think that the [Inaudible]?**

*You know how I feel. Okay, we'll see you in --**

*[Inaudible]**

*What?**

*[Inaudible] call a national emergency?**

*I'm not looking to call a national emergency. This is so simple, you shouldn't have to. Now, I have the absolute legal right to call it, but I'm not looking to do that because this is too simple. The Democrats should say, "We want border security." We have to build a wall, otherwise you can't have border security.**

*And we should get on with our lives. The Democrats are stopping us, and they're stopping a lot of great people from getting paid. All they have to do is say, "We want border security." That automatically means a wall or a barrier. Thank you. I'll see you in New Orleans.**

*Mr. President, what about Steve King's remarks on white supremacy?**

*Who?**

*Steve King. Congressman Steve King. He said white supremacy --**

*I don't -- I haven't been following it. I really haven't been following it.**

*Mr. President, Kellyanne Conway said in a gaggle [Inaudible] you are close on a deal. Do you agree with Kellyanne that you think that you're close on a deal?**

*A deal with what?**

*In terms of ending the shutdown.**

*I don't know if we're close on a deal. This should be the easiest deal that I've ever seen. We're talking about border security. Who could be against it? We're talking about drugs pouring in -- human traffickers tying up women, putting tape on their mouth, and pouring into our country. We can't have that.**

*We can't have that. We have drugs, we have criminals, we have gangs, and the Democrats don't want to do anything about it. They say, "Oh, it's immoral." But it wasn’t immoral three years ago, five years ago, six years ago, and ten years ago, when they all raised their hands to approve a wall. All of the sudden, it's immoral.**

*It's immoral because -- one reason. Because they know they're going to lose in the 2020 election. That's the only reason, to them, it's immoral.**

*Mr. President, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has called you a "racist."**

*Who did?**

*Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.**

*Who cares. She's --**

*Mr. President, what was your take from last week's talks with China about trade?**

*We're doing very well with China. They're having a hard time with their economy because of the tariffs. We're doing very well with our economy. We're at records -- our unemployment numbers just hit a record, another record. We're doing extremely well, as a country. We're doing better than any country right now, anywhere in the world.**

*China wants to negotiate. I have a great relationship with President Xi because it's good to have relationships with Russia, and China, and Japan, and India. And I have relationships with almost everybody, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. I think that we are going to be able to do a deal with China.**

*We are -- I can tell you, we are getting things that, before I became President, you would have had no chance of getting. They would have laughed at your President's face.**

*[Inaudible]**

*The people that started that investigation are McCabe, who's a proven liar and was fired from the FBI; or Lisa Page, who was forced to leave the FBI, and her lover, Peter Stzrok, who -- we got their text messages, and what they said in those text messages was shocking, when you talk about bias. And also Comey.**

*And I guess they started it because I fired Comey, which was a great thing I did for our country. So the people doing that investigation were people that have been caught that are known scoundrels. They're, in many -- I guess you could say they're "dirty cops." And I'll tell you what, it is so unfair what's happened to the FBI, in terms of the men and women working in the rank and file of the FBI. I know many of them.**

*These are great people, and they are so embarrassed by their leadership. You've never seen -- I have never seen a turnaround in a bureau or agency like I have with the FBI. They are so embarrassed. I think 12 people now have been terminated. And others -- if you look at what's happening, others are going to go. What happened at the FBI -- So when you say, "Should I have confidence in the FBI or intelligence agencies?" When I see Ohr and I see all of these people; when I see Lisa and her lover, and their notes and their texts get captured, and you see what they said about me, having nothing to do with the investigation.**

*Let me tell you something, when people see that, you have an angry country because the whole thing is a hoax. It's a big hoax, and it's very bad for our country. So what happened with the FBI -- I have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey because he was a bad cop, and he was a dirty cop, and he lied.**

*He really lied. And all you have to do --**

*[Crosstalk]**

*Wait a minute. And all you have to do is take a look at the crooked Hillary Clinton investigation, where they brought her on the July 4th weekend -- July 4th. They didn't swear her in. They didn't do any tapes. They didn't do anything. They just let her go. And she usually said, mostly said, "I don't know." She didn't know anything.**

*Just like James Comey, a week ago. He was interviewed by Congress. And, you know, unfortunately, people didn't see it because the Republicans, with Paul Ryan, unfortunately, they didn't put him out there. But what he said was -- either he's a bad liar or he's grossly incompetent. Unfortunately, people didn't see it, but you can read the transcript.**

*[Inaudible]**

*What?**

*Do you think that the [Inaudible]?**

*You know how I feel. Okay, we'll see you in --**

*[Inaudible]**

*What?**

*[Inaudible] call a national emergency?**

*I'm not looking to call a national emergency. This is so simple, you shouldn't have to. Now, I have the absolute legal right to call it, but I'm not looking to do that because this is too simple. The Democrats should say, "We want border security." We have to build a wall, otherwise you can't have border security.**

*And we should get on with our lives. The Democrats are stopping us, and they're stopping a lot of great people from getting paid. All they have to do is say, "We want border security." That automatically means a wall or a barrier. Thank you. I'll see you in New Orleans.**

*Wow! Wow, what a group. Look at that quarterback. Oh, I want to be the agent of that tall, handsome quarterback. [Laughter] Six-foot-seven. They say great athlete, and he's accurate. That's nice. Great job. And you're 18?**

*Yes, sir.**

*Boy, that's some -- you got a good future. [Laughter] Good future. Congratulations, that's fantastic. And, Coach, congratulations. I mean, the whole thing. You --**

*Thank you, sir.**

*And the coach -- you. What a job, huh?**

*Thank you, sir. [Applause]**

*What a job. What a job, Coach. [Applause] So, thank you all. We had a little something different. You know, we had to make a decision. We could have seen you in about two months, and I know a lot of you are off to all sorts of camps and they're all checking you out. And you're going to be wealthy as hell, in some cases.**

*[Laughter] In other cases, you're going to be coming back and you're going to have another great year. I don't know if you can ever do 15 and 0. I hear that's a first time, right?**

*Yes, sir**

*Fifteen-and-oh.**

*Yes, sir.**

*Has that ever happened before? I don't think so. [Applause] So, I don't know, but you'll do as good, right? You'll do as good. But -- so, I had a choice: Do we have no food for you? Because we have a shutdown. Or do we give you some little, quick salads that the First Lady will make along with the Second Lady.**

*They'll make some salads. [Laughter] And I said you guys aren't into salads. Or do I go out -- Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott -- do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers? [Laughter] Big Macs. So we actually did. We bought 1,000 -- Burger King, all American companies. Burger King, Wendy's, and McDonald's. We have Big Macs.**

*We have quarter-pounders with cheese. We have everything that I like, that you like. [Laughter] And I know no matter what we did, there's nothing you can have that's better than that, right? [Laughter] And so we ordered. We literally have -- and I don't know, have they started eating and devouring? [Audience calls out Yes]**

*I wanted to see -- so, it was piled up a mile high. I just wanted to see what was left. I saw it at the beginning. How much is left back there? How much? They go, "Not much." [Laughter] Well, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for being here. We're truly thrilled to welcome to the White House the 2018 College Football National Champions, the Clemson University Tigers.**

*Very famous team right now, the way you're playing. [Applause] Very famous team. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. We had such a wonderful time two years ago. I got to know your President, I got to know your coach. And -- very special people. Really, very special people. What a job you've done, I'll tell you what.**

*And, Coach, what a job you've done. Very -- very unusual. You know, there are other teams with a lot of talent, and they're watching us tonight on live television. You got a lot of [Inaudible]. [Laughter] They're watching us and they're saying, "We'll get them next year." [Laughter] And maybe they will, but I don't think you think so, Coach.**

*Right? You feel good about next year, right?**

*Yes, sir.**

*How many are coming back next year?**

*Enough. We got enough. [Laughter]**

*Enough. They'll have -- and a couple of new ones coming in, I'll bet.**

*[Inaudible]**

*Nobody is going to feel bad. That's good. Well, we're going to have you back. And you're going to be back. And I said that to you last time. But last year -- we skipped a year -- but I said to the coach last time -- I said, "You'll be back." And it turned out to be pretty soon. To the University President, Jim Clements; Board Chairman Smyth McKissick -- where is Smyth?**

*Come on, Smyth. You got to get up here, Smyth. Come on. I mean, you are the chairman. [Applause] Dan Radakovich. Where's Dan? Athletic Director. Come on, Dan. Get up here, Dan. [Applause] Coach Dabo Swinney. Everybody knows Dabo. Is he doing a good job? You're going to keep him for this season? [Applause] Huh? You're satisfied with his results, right?**

*I would think. And all of the incredible players here. And you are incredible athletes, incredible players. Congratulations on your stunning victory against a great team and your second national championship in three years. Pretty incredible. Joining us today, we have a few of our biggest fans: Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, who is doing a fantastic -- where's Steve?**

*[Applause] Couldn't make your team. We would never be able to make your team, that I can tell you. Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who is a great player. He was in the Rose Bowl, actually. Matt Whitaker right here. [Applause] I won't tell you whether he won or lost in the Rose Bowl, but they played a good game, right?**

*And he's a -- he was a great football player. Senator Lindsey Graham. [Applause] Lindsey? Acting Secretary of Defense, Pat Shanahan. A big fan of yours, too. Pat. [Applause] Another great friend of mine, and Lindsey's and everybody -- and is a highly respected man, big football fan: Tim Scott. Senator Tim Scott.**

*[Applause] Thank you, Tim. Thanks. Congressman Jeff Duncan. [Applause] Thank you, Jeff. Great. Hi, Jeff. Also with us is our new Chief of Staff and a former congressman from the great state of South Carolina, Mick Mulvaney. He's doing a fantastic job. Thank you, Mick. [Applause] And we have a lot of other great politicians here.**

*Great successful politicians. And I have to say, what you've done is very inspiring to a lot of people -- to everybody. The Clemson Tiger football team has earned its place in the history books as the first team since 1897 to finish the season with an undefeated 15 and 0 record. Eighteen. Can you imagine that?**

*That's a long time ago, Coach. [Laughter] Yeah, just do as well next year. [Laughs] That is really -- 1897. The senior players on the team have won 55 games over the past four years -- an incredible fact. You’re tied with the Alabama seniors for the most wins in Division I history. And the biggest win of all came in the final game between these two titans -- they are titans -- with a jaw-dropping 44 to 16 Clemson win over the Alabama Crimson Tide.**

*And Alabama went in, and they felt confident. But, boy, right from the beginning, the job you did. Trevor Lawrence -- where's Trevor? Trevor Lawrence. [Applause] There's Trevor. That's what I thought. Showed why he's among the best in college football, despite being a 19-year-old true freshman, throwing for 347 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions.**

*And, by the way, as I remember, a couple of not-bad runs, right? They said you're a great athlete, aside from everything else. And you're also an accurate thrower. It's nice to see. This season, he racked up more than 3,200 yards in the air, which is tremendous. And it's certainly not a bad way to start a college career.**

*Has there ever been a start like this of a college career for a quarterback, Coach -- I think, as a freshman? That's pretty good, right?**

*Don't think so.**

*Yeah. I think the coach is satisfied. He feels good. [Laughter] Trevor, he likes you, okay? You'll be -- I don't think you're worried about -- he's not being -- he's not worried about being beat out next season, I don't think, at the beginning. I don't think so. Although, there are probably a couple of guys in here, Trevor, you got to be careful, right?**

*There are probably -- who's gunning for him? Who? Whose hands? A couple of guys. Oh, look at them. I know how that stuff works. That's all right. Good luck to everybody. [Laughter] Hey, lots of luck right now. It's a little -- great. The good news for Clemson fans is that he won’t be eligible for the NFL draft for another two years, okay?**

*Good. Great career. Wide receiver -- I watch you -- Hunter Renfrow began his career -- where's Hunter? Hunter. Great. [Applause] Great job, Hunter -- as a walk-on. He finished it with two receptions in the championship game, and he was drawing coverage all over the place, wasn't he? I could see that. They were talking about it. They were all over you.**

*Drawing coverage anywhere he went on the field, which made it a lot easier for some of the other folks. So, great job. Great job, Hunter. Fantastic. Defensive coordinator Brent Venables is here today. Where's Brent? [Applause] Where's Brent? Wow. And I'll tell you, he didn't get a very good location here.**

*That's -- are you okay back there, Brent?**

*I'm good. Yes, sir.**

*Okay. [Laughter] Three times, your defense stopped Alabama cold in the red zone. True. An incredible feat -- a feat that people said couldn't happen. Alabama averaged 48 points per game this season. Clemson’s defense held them to just 16 in the championship game. Amazing. Cornerback A.J. Terrell played a leading role, with eight tackles, a forced fumble, and a big 44-yard interception return for a touchdown that put Clemson on the board and set a course --- and really set the course for the game.**

*Right from the beginning. Coach Swinney says that “all of us have greatness inside of us” no matter who we are or where we come from. And, gentlemen, you proved that so much this season. The entire season. Not just the one game -- one game was incredible -- but you proved it over a full season. No bad moments.**

*It takes a special leader to bring out the greatness in others. Dabo Swinney is just that kind of a leader. I knew that when I met him two years ago. I said, this guy is a special guy. He inspires. He's a very unique guy. Isn't he? Really a unique guy. And he's getting a little embarrassed over here. [Laughter] It's true, Coach.**

*It's true. So, Coach Swinney has brought Clemson eight consecutives, 10-win seasons -- and I know the competition that you have -- three Bear Bryant Coach of the Year awards, and now, a third national championship. And that's really incredible. Really incredible. The most important thing is he's helped countless young Americans set high standards for themselves, reach for excellence, and achieve their full God-given potential.**

*After the championship game, Dabo -- something was really, truly profound, people saw. He said, "When you get a young group of people that believe, that are passionate, that love each other" -- that’s six-foot-nine and weigh 397 pounds of pure muscle -- [Laughter] -- he didn't say that, by the way, that's -- I add that, okay?**

*You know, that helps too, Coach, right? I mean, in all fairness, that helps. [Laughter] "That sacrifice, that are committed to a singleness of purpose, you better look out, great things can happen.” And that's what happened. Incredible people. You'll always go down as winners. The biggest winners. Fifteen-and-oh. What a beautiful message for our country: If we believe in each other, if we love each other, if we are committed to making life better for all of our citizens, then great things will always happen for America.**

*We know Coach Swinney is right, because you proved it with your incredible victory and, really, your incredible victories over a long period of time -- not even this season. So to all of the amazing athletes here today that wiped out more food than any human being has ever seen before, including me -- [Laughter] -- I've never seen so much -– thank you for inspiring America.**

*You really have. Fellas, you inspire our country. That was an inspiration. Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, all of you here, I think that was a great -- Congressman, right? That was an inspiration for our country, especially from two senators that happen to come from your state. They were very happy, I will tell you.**

*They were very, very happy people. Very proud. Congratulations once again to the National Champions, the Clemson Tigers -- one of the best teams ever in the history of college football. Now I'm proud to introduce your coach, Coach Swinney, and your University President, Jim Clements. Very special people.**

*You know, it's very funny -- I meet people and I say, "Hello, how you doing? Everything good? See ya. Best of luck." And that's the end. I remembered these two people. They're very special people. And they prove that by winning like nobody else has been able to win. And, by the way, Clemson is also a great, great school.**

*So, thank you very much for being at the White House. It's a very special place; built in 1799. And it just has a special feel about it. It's just really an incredible -- an incredible building. It's an incredible home. Thank you all. It's your home. Thank you very much for being here. And, Coach, please say a few words. [Applause]**

*Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity. What a fun day it's been. It's an honor to be a part of this tradition. And to be honest with you, it's really cool that football can create an opportunity like this. And I stand here before you as a guy from Pelham, Alabama, and I'm looking at all these young people from all over this country.**

*And I have to look at my mom, because I came to Washington, D.C. on a train, in the fifth grade, and we didn’t -- she didn’t have enough money to come with me. But here we are now, many, many years later, and we're getting to have a chance to have a moment like this. So, football matters. And football, and the relationships through football, created this opportunity.**

*And for that, I'm so thankful. It's been an unbelievably crazy week. Literally, a crazy week. But it's great to receive this recognition, to see this team honored for its amazing season. One week ago today, as a matter fact, we were at the stadium getting ready to go, but -- getting ready to kick it off.**

*But one week ago today, we all enjoyed a magical and historic moment as our team became the first 15 and 0 team in modern football history. And one of the things that we talked about, and you guys know, is -- you know, we say all the time: Greatness is not your destiny, greatness is not your right; it's a decision.**

*You know, we always say: Championships are won when the stands are empty; champions are made when nobody is watching. And this team -- this team right here made a decision to be great, and was special from day one. We had our goals, and y'all all know what our goals are. But more importantly, our daily commitment was greater than those goals.**

*And that's what it takes to do something special. And our staff -- all of our staff is here -- what an amazing job our staff did. It says in Proverbs that, "Where there is no counsel, the people fall. But in the multitude of counselors, there is safety." And we've been so consistent at Clemson because I've got a multitude of good counselors.**

*A lot of good people. Unbelievable staff. Great continuity. A bunch of great, young people that buy in and choose to be about the right things and to think the right way, and to lay it on the line for their university and for each other. And people talk a lot about X's and O's in my business. You know, we talk a lot about X's and O's. But this game, to me, is really about hearts and souls.**

*And last Monday, you saw on full display the heart and soul of this team. They played with a will to win that just would not be denied. And one of the things that we talk about all the time, in Colossians 3:23: Whatever you do, you do it with all your heart. It doesn’t matter what you're doing; you do it with all your heart.**

*Because when you do things with your heart, you go above and beyond; you do the extra. And this team, they put their heart into it, and they went above and beyond in every area. We always say, the fun is in the winning. And it is in the winning. But to me, it's how you win that matters the most. On the field -- hey, 15 and 0, there's really nothing else you can say.**

*We had 13 of those wins by 20 points or more. Our seniors, 55 wins in a four-year period -- most in the history of college football. We had the number-one scoring defense in the country. And we had the most points ever scored in Clemson history. But off the field -- so it's not just winning. It's how you win.**

*Off the field, this very same team that set out to be the best ever, they had the best ever team GPA in the history of our Clemson program. We had 66 guys make a 3.0 or better. Our record, previously, was 56. They shattered it. They went above and beyond in every area. We won the AFCA academic award, number one out of 130 teams.**

*We won the top academic award, awarded by the American Football Coaches Association. And then, in New York, back in December, Christian Wilkins won the Academic Heisman, which goes to the top student athlete in all levels of football. So when I tell you this team was committed to excellence in all areas, they were truly committed.**

*And in the end, that's what we're all going to be defined by. That's what our program is going to be defined by; not by these trophies. Our program is going to be defined by the type of men that leave our program. And what they do when they get out in the society, the type of future presidents they become, and governors, and CEOs, and coaches, and teachers, and NFL players -- whatever it is -- that's what our program is going to be defined by. We got a quote that we kind of live by. We started the season and kind of talked about this quote.**

*And I don't know who said it, but it says this. It says: What you can vividly imagine and ardently believe, and enthusiastically act upon, will inevitably come to be. This team dreamed big, they believed big. And last Monday, you saw them enthusiastically act upon that dream and belief. But my favorite part of this team, and what I'll always remember, is that they truly enjoyed the journey.**

*I can’t tell you how many times we kind of hit pause. A lot of times, with young people, everybody wants to hit fast-forward. But this team, we hit pause a lot, and really, truly enjoyed the journey. And it really made it so much spec- -- more special for me. And in the end, that's what it should be about: just finding joy in the journey of whatever it is that we're doing.**

*So I want to close, and I really want to give this perspective to our team and, really, to anybody who's listening. This is a quote. And the whole college football world was captured by Tyler Trent. He was the Purdue football fan that was battling cancer. You probably saw that he just passed, just recently.**

*And here's what he said. He put out a quote, and he said: "Though I am in hospice care and have to wake up every morning knowing that the day might be my last, I still have a choice to make: to make that day the best it can be. Yet, isn’t that a choice we all have every day? After all, nobody knows the amount of days that we have left.**

*Some could say we are all in hospice, to a certain degree. So why don't we act like it? Where is your gratitude? With Christmas coming up, what are you thankful for? I had to write my will recently, and I'm just grateful that I can give my family Christmas presents, maybe even for [The] last time. Let's not forget that my doctors gave me three months to live almost two and a half months ago.**

*So why can't we live grateful lives? Why can't we make every day count like it's the last?" So for this team, and all you guys moving on, and even the guys coming back, that's what I would say, is go live and be great today. In order for your Sunday to become a reality, you just got to be your best today and truly enjoy the journey, because I always believe the best is yet to come.**

*So, President Trump, I can't thank you enough for this very special opportunity, and all the dignitaries here, to honor our football team on something that we earned and something that happened all the way on the other coast, in California, one week ago. What a special moment we will remember for the rest of our lives.**

*But it pales in comparison to the relationships and the journey that it took to get there. But on behalf of our team, our staff, the Board of Trustees, our president, and our AD, I want to thank you so much for this opportunity that you gave us. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Thank you, Coach, for those kind words. Thank you, Mr. President, for your kind and inspirational words. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here. Good evening. Go Tigers! I'm only stepping up because the President asked me to come on up. So I'm going to go ahead and add to my thanks. Mr. President, it is great to be back at the White House, for the second time in the past 19 months, with our football team to celebrate our national championship.**

*Mr. President, I appreciate very much your kindness and your hospitality, and the fine dinner that you served us, and for inviting us to be with you today. It is an honor and a privilege to be standing here in the White House as we celebrate the accomplishments of this amazing group of men who represent Clemson so well, on and off the field.**

*I do want to thank, if I can, Mr. President, our Board of Trustees for their outstanding leadership. We're blessed at Clemson to have an incredible Board who cares deeply about Clemson academics and athletics. So I do want to thank the entire South Carolina congressional delegation for their strong support of our great university.**

*And I know, Mr. President, you pointed them out, but in particular I do want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott for being here this evening and for always supporting us. I also want to thank Congressman Jeff Duncan, a proud Clemson alumnus and former Clemson football player who does an outstanding job in our home district.**

*Would you please help me thank them for all they do for the university? [Applause] And, Mr. President, I do also want to thank our Governor, Henry McMaster, for his leadership of our great state. The Governor was not able to join us tonight due to a scheduling conflict, but he did want me to pass on to you his warm regards.**

*Tonight, we honor these young men and these coaches who are a wonderful example of the high standards we set in everything that we do at Clemson, from athletics to academics. These student athletes, as you know, worked incredibly hard to accomplish their dream of being the number-one college football team and the only one in the modern era to go a perfect 15 and 0. And I want you to know, gentlemen, you made the Clemson family proud along that journey.**

*And, Mr. President, our players succeed in the classroom, as well. We had 26 players on this team who earned their degree. That was more than any other team to play in a bowl game. And this championships, as I said, on Saturday was truly a team victory -- from our student athletes who worked so hard on the field and in practice, to our coaches, to our recruiting staff, to the social media team, to our faculty, to the academic advisors in the Nieri Center, to the medical staff and trainers, to the facilities team, to the support staff, to our donors, and all of those who worked in any way, shape, or form for this program.**

*All of them played an important role in making this happen. And, of course, I'm very thankful that this team is led by Coach Dabo Swinney, a man of great integrity and of the highest character, who is on a serious mission that goes beyond football. And he cares so very deeply about developing his players into young men who will be successful in life.**

*And I do want to acknowledge and thank our outstanding Athletic Director, Dan Radakovich. His leadership has taken Clemson athletics to the highest level possible. Coach Swinney has a motto that all of you know, and many of us at the university have adopted that, and this is: Best is the standard. At Clemson, we strive every day to live up to that standard across the entire university.**

*The success of our football team and athletics, in general, has helped to elevate the entire profile of our great university. We're at an all-time high in almost every possible measure, from academic rankings, to applications, to retention rates, graduation rates, fundraising, research funding, ACT scores, SAT scores, and so many other measures.**

*We are determined -- all of us in this room and back at the university -- to keep pushing every single day to make a difference and to take Clemson to greater heights and service to our students, to our home state of South Carolina, and to this great country. Thank you again, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.**

*Thank you for inviting us. Thank you for recognizing the Clemson University National Championship team. May God bless you all. And go Tigers. [Applause]**

*And as your president said, that president, he has done some job. We can never forget the great job he's done as a school, as a university. That's a fantastic -- a fantastic place, with an unbelievable reputation on its own. I think we're going to take the entire football team down to another special place, the Oval Office.**

*And I remember two years ago -- [Applause] -- two years ago, Coach, we did that. And a lot of other Presidents don’t do that. And we did it, and it seemed to have worked, right? [Laughter] Whatever it was. Because they all wanted to come back. So we're going to go; we're going to take the team down. I thought before I did that, I'd ask Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott -- two people that have represented your state very, very well and that love your team, and very special friends of mine.**

*So maybe I'll start off with Tim and Lindsey, and say a couple of words. And we're going to travel down to a very, very important location, the Oval Office. Okay? We'll do that. We'll take pictures. Good? He likes that. Good. [Applause] Please, Tim. Please.**

*Well, God bless you. How many of you guys are incredibly excited to be at the White House? [Applause] [Laughs] How many are looking forward to going down to the Oval Office? [Applause] How about we all -- how about we all give President Trump an amazing round of applause for being here tonight? [Applause] My comments will be quick.**

*South Carolina is so proud of Clemson University, and specifically the athletes who represent us so well off the field as much as you do on the field. I can't say it any better than Dabo said it himself a few weeks ago; maybe it was championship night. He said, if you put God first, others second, and then yourself, amazing things can happen. This is a fulfillment of that mission. [Applause]**

*Well, they said be short. I started this speech short and I'll end it short. [Laughter] You can tell this is an educated crowd. So I grew up in Central South Carolina. Anybody know where that's at? [Applause] Yeah. So when the Tigers played, it was good. My dad owned the liquor store, so every Saturday was good for business.**

*I went to Pelham, Alabama on vacation, Dabo. [Laughter] So, Tim has an incredible story. Mr. President, you have an incredible story. But these young men here, you have a story that nobody else can tell. Go Tigers. [Applause]**

*Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you, Tim. So, Coach, let's go on down to the Oval. And if the team would just follow -- I'm going to say, follow your coach. Well, follow your coach. But let's go to the Oval. Let's take some really great pictures that you're going to have for a long time. A long time. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. A tremendous honor. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Wow! Wow, what a group. Look at that quarterback. Oh, I want to be the agent of that tall, handsome quarterback. [Laughter] Six-foot-seven. They say great athlete, and he's accurate. That's nice. Great job. And you're 18?**

*Yes, sir.**

*Boy, that's some -- you got a good future. [Laughter] Good future. Congratulations, that's fantastic. And, Coach, congratulations. I mean, the whole thing. You --**

*Thank you, sir.**

*And the coach -- you. What a job, huh?**

*Thank you, sir. [Applause]**

*What a job. What a job, Coach. [Applause] So, thank you all. We had a little something different. You know, we had to make a decision. We could have seen you in about two months, and I know a lot of you are off to all sorts of camps and they're all checking you out. And you're going to be wealthy as hell, in some cases.**

*[Laughter] In other cases, you're going to be coming back and you're going to have another great year. I don't know if you can ever do 15 and 0. I hear that's a first time, right?**

*Yes, sir**

*Fifteen-and-oh.**

*Yes, sir.**

*Has that ever happened before? I don't think so. [Applause] So, I don't know, but you'll do as good, right? You'll do as good. But -- so, I had a choice: Do we have no food for you? Because we have a shutdown. Or do we give you some little, quick salads that the First Lady will make along with the Second Lady.**

*They'll make some salads. [Laughter] And I said you guys aren't into salads. Or do I go out -- Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott -- do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers? [Laughter] Big Macs. So we actually did. We bought 1,000 -- Burger King, all American companies. Burger King, Wendy's, and McDonald's. We have Big Macs.**

*We have quarter-pounders with cheese. We have everything that I like, that you like. [Laughter] And I know no matter what we did, there's nothing you can have that's better than that, right? [Laughter] And so we ordered. We literally have -- and I don't know, have they started eating and devouring? [Audience calls out Yes]**

*I wanted to see -- so, it was piled up a mile high. I just wanted to see what was left. I saw it at the beginning. How much is left back there? How much? They go, "Not much." [Laughter] Well, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for being here. We're truly thrilled to welcome to the White House the 2018 College Football National Champions, the Clemson University Tigers.**

*Very famous team right now, the way you're playing. [Applause] Very famous team. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. We had such a wonderful time two years ago. I got to know your President, I got to know your coach. And -- very special people. Really, very special people. What a job you've done, I'll tell you what.**

*And, Coach, what a job you've done. Very -- very unusual. You know, there are other teams with a lot of talent, and they're watching us tonight on live television. You got a lot of [Inaudible]. [Laughter] They're watching us and they're saying, "We'll get them next year." [Laughter] And maybe they will, but I don't think you think so, Coach.**

*Right? You feel good about next year, right?**

*Yes, sir.**

*How many are coming back next year?**

*Enough. We got enough. [Laughter]**

*Enough. They'll have -- and a couple of new ones coming in, I'll bet.**

*[Inaudible]**

*Nobody is going to feel bad. That's good. Well, we're going to have you back. And you're going to be back. And I said that to you last time. But last year -- we skipped a year -- but I said to the coach last time -- I said, "You'll be back." And it turned out to be pretty soon. To the University President, Jim Clements; Board Chairman Smyth McKissick -- where is Smyth?**

*Come on, Smyth. You got to get up here, Smyth. Come on. I mean, you are the chairman. [Applause] Dan Radakovich. Where's Dan? Athletic Director. Come on, Dan. Get up here, Dan. [Applause] Coach Dabo Swinney. Everybody knows Dabo. Is he doing a good job? You're going to keep him for this season? [Applause] Huh? You're satisfied with his results, right?**

*I would think. And all of the incredible players here. And you are incredible athletes, incredible players. Congratulations on your stunning victory against a great team and your second national championship in three years. Pretty incredible. Joining us today, we have a few of our biggest fans: Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, who is doing a fantastic -- where's Steve?**

*[Applause] Couldn't make your team. We would never be able to make your team, that I can tell you. Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who is a great player. He was in the Rose Bowl, actually. Matt Whitaker right here. [Applause] I won't tell you whether he won or lost in the Rose Bowl, but they played a good game, right?**

*And he's a -- he was a great football player. Senator Lindsey Graham. [Applause] Lindsey? Acting Secretary of Defense, Pat Shanahan. A big fan of yours, too. Pat. [Applause] Another great friend of mine, and Lindsey's and everybody -- and is a highly respected man, big football fan: Tim Scott. Senator Tim Scott.**

*[Applause] Thank you, Tim. Thanks. Congressman Jeff Duncan. [Applause] Thank you, Jeff. Great. Hi, Jeff. Also with us is our new Chief of Staff and a former congressman from the great state of South Carolina, Mick Mulvaney. He's doing a fantastic job. Thank you, Mick. [Applause] And we have a lot of other great politicians here.**

*Great successful politicians. And I have to say, what you've done is very inspiring to a lot of people -- to everybody. The Clemson Tiger football team has earned its place in the history books as the first team since 1897 to finish the season with an undefeated 15 and 0 record. Eighteen. Can you imagine that?**

*That's a long time ago, Coach. [Laughter] Yeah, just do as well next year. [Laughs] That is really -- 1897. The senior players on the team have won 55 games over the past four years -- an incredible fact. You’re tied with the Alabama seniors for the most wins in Division I history. And the biggest win of all came in the final game between these two titans -- they are titans -- with a jaw-dropping 44 to 16 Clemson win over the Alabama Crimson Tide.**

*And Alabama went in, and they felt confident. But, boy, right from the beginning, the job you did. Trevor Lawrence -- where's Trevor? Trevor Lawrence. [Applause] There's Trevor. That's what I thought. Showed why he's among the best in college football, despite being a 19-year-old true freshman, throwing for 347 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions.**

*And, by the way, as I remember, a couple of not-bad runs, right? They said you're a great athlete, aside from everything else. And you're also an accurate thrower. It's nice to see. This season, he racked up more than 3,200 yards in the air, which is tremendous. And it's certainly not a bad way to start a college career.**

*Has there ever been a start like this of a college career for a quarterback, Coach -- I think, as a freshman? That's pretty good, right?**

*Don't think so.**

*Yeah. I think the coach is satisfied. He feels good. [Laughter] Trevor, he likes you, okay? You'll be -- I don't think you're worried about -- he's not being -- he's not worried about being beat out next season, I don't think, at the beginning. I don't think so. Although, there are probably a couple of guys in here, Trevor, you got to be careful, right?**

*There are probably -- who's gunning for him? Who? Whose hands? A couple of guys. Oh, look at them. I know how that stuff works. That's all right. Good luck to everybody. [Laughter] Hey, lots of luck right now. It's a little -- great. The good news for Clemson fans is that he won’t be eligible for the NFL draft for another two years, okay?**

*Good. Great career. Wide receiver -- I watch you -- Hunter Renfrow began his career -- where's Hunter? Hunter. Great. [Applause] Great job, Hunter -- as a walk-on. He finished it with two receptions in the championship game, and he was drawing coverage all over the place, wasn't he? I could see that. They were talking about it. They were all over you.**

*Drawing coverage anywhere he went on the field, which made it a lot easier for some of the other folks. So, great job. Great job, Hunter. Fantastic. Defensive coordinator Brent Venables is here today. Where's Brent? [Applause] Where's Brent? Wow. And I'll tell you, he didn't get a very good location here.**

*That's -- are you okay back there, Brent?**

*I'm good. Yes, sir.**

*Okay. [Laughter] Three times, your defense stopped Alabama cold in the red zone. True. An incredible feat -- a feat that people said couldn't happen. Alabama averaged 48 points per game this season. Clemson’s defense held them to just 16 in the championship game. Amazing. Cornerback A.J. Terrell played a leading role, with eight tackles, a forced fumble, and a big 44-yard interception return for a touchdown that put Clemson on the board and set a course --- and really set the course for the game.**

*Right from the beginning. Coach Swinney says that “all of us have greatness inside of us” no matter who we are or where we come from. And, gentlemen, you proved that so much this season. The entire season. Not just the one game -- one game was incredible -- but you proved it over a full season. No bad moments.**

*It takes a special leader to bring out the greatness in others. Dabo Swinney is just that kind of a leader. I knew that when I met him two years ago. I said, this guy is a special guy. He inspires. He's a very unique guy. Isn't he? Really a unique guy. And he's getting a little embarrassed over here. [Laughter] It's true, Coach.**

*It's true. So, Coach Swinney has brought Clemson eight consecutives, 10-win seasons -- and I know the competition that you have -- three Bear Bryant Coach of the Year awards, and now, a third national championship. And that's really incredible. Really incredible. The most important thing is he's helped countless young Americans set high standards for themselves, reach for excellence, and achieve their full God-given potential.**

*After the championship game, Dabo -- something was really, truly profound, people saw. He said, "When you get a young group of people that believe, that are passionate, that love each other" -- that’s six-foot-nine and weigh 397 pounds of pure muscle -- [Laughter] -- he didn't say that, by the way, that's -- I add that, okay?**

*You know, that helps too, Coach, right? I mean, in all fairness, that helps. [Laughter] "That sacrifice, that are committed to a singleness of purpose, you better look out, great things can happen.” And that's what happened. Incredible people. You'll always go down as winners. The biggest winners. Fifteen-and-oh. What a beautiful message for our country: If we believe in each other, if we love each other, if we are committed to making life better for all of our citizens, then great things will always happen for America.**

*We know Coach Swinney is right, because you proved it with your incredible victory and, really, your incredible victories over a long period of time -- not even this season. So to all of the amazing athletes here today that wiped out more food than any human being has ever seen before, including me -- [Laughter] -- I've never seen so much -– thank you for inspiring America.**

*You really have. Fellas, you inspire our country. That was an inspiration. Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, all of you here, I think that was a great -- Congressman, right? That was an inspiration for our country, especially from two senators that happen to come from your state. They were very happy, I will tell you.**

*They were very, very happy people. Very proud. Congratulations once again to the National Champions, the Clemson Tigers -- one of the best teams ever in the history of college football. Now I'm proud to introduce your coach, Coach Swinney, and your University President, Jim Clements. Very special people.**

*You know, it's very funny -- I meet people and I say, "Hello, how you doing? Everything good? See ya. Best of luck." And that's the end. I remembered these two people. They're very special people. And they prove that by winning like nobody else has been able to win. And, by the way, Clemson is also a great, great school.**

*So, thank you very much for being at the White House. It's a very special place; built in 1799. And it just has a special feel about it. It's just really an incredible -- an incredible building. It's an incredible home. Thank you all. It's your home. Thank you very much for being here. And, Coach, please say a few words. [Applause]**

*Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity. What a fun day it's been. It's an honor to be a part of this tradition. And to be honest with you, it's really cool that football can create an opportunity like this. And I stand here before you as a guy from Pelham, Alabama, and I'm looking at all these young people from all over this country.**

*And I have to look at my mom, because I came to Washington, D.C. on a train, in the fifth grade, and we didn’t -- she didn’t have enough money to come with me. But here we are now, many, many years later, and we're getting to have a chance to have a moment like this. So, football matters. And football, and the relationships through football, created this opportunity.**

*And for that, I'm so thankful. It's been an unbelievably crazy week. Literally, a crazy week. But it's great to receive this recognition, to see this team honored for its amazing season. One week ago today, as a matter fact, we were at the stadium getting ready to go, but -- getting ready to kick it off.**

*But one week ago today, we all enjoyed a magical and historic moment as our team became the first 15 and 0 team in modern football history. And one of the things that we talked about, and you guys know, is -- you know, we say all the time: Greatness is not your destiny, greatness is not your right; it's a decision.**

*You know, we always say: Championships are won when the stands are empty; champions are made when nobody is watching. And this team -- this team right here made a decision to be great, and was special from day one. We had our goals, and y'all all know what our goals are. But more importantly, our daily commitment was greater than those goals.**

*And that's what it takes to do something special. And our staff -- all of our staff is here -- what an amazing job our staff did. It says in Proverbs that, "Where there is no counsel, the people fall. But in the multitude of counselors, there is safety." And we've been so consistent at Clemson because I've got a multitude of good counselors.**

*A lot of good people. Unbelievable staff. Great continuity. A bunch of great, young people that buy in and choose to be about the right things and to think the right way, and to lay it on the line for their university and for each other. And people talk a lot about X's and O's in my business. You know, we talk a lot about X's and O's. But this game, to me, is really about hearts and souls.**

*And last Monday, you saw on full display the heart and soul of this team. They played with a will to win that just would not be denied. And one of the things that we talk about all the time, in Colossians 3:23: Whatever you do, you do it with all your heart. It doesn’t matter what you're doing; you do it with all your heart.**

*Because when you do things with your heart, you go above and beyond; you do the extra. And this team, they put their heart into it, and they went above and beyond in every area. We always say, the fun is in the winning. And it is in the winning. But to me, it's how you win that matters the most. On the field -- hey, 15 and 0, there's really nothing else you can say.**

*We had 13 of those wins by 20 points or more. Our seniors, 55 wins in a four-year period -- most in the history of college football. We had the number-one scoring defense in the country. And we had the most points ever scored in Clemson history. But off the field -- so it's not just winning. It's how you win.**

*Off the field, this very same team that set out to be the best ever, they had the best ever team GPA in the history of our Clemson program. We had 66 guys make a 3.0 or better. Our record, previously, was 56. They shattered it. They went above and beyond in every area. We won the AFCA academic award, number one out of 130 teams.**

*We won the top academic award, awarded by the American Football Coaches Association. And then, in New York, back in December, Christian Wilkins won the Academic Heisman, which goes to the top student athlete in all levels of football. So when I tell you this team was committed to excellence in all areas, they were truly committed.**

*And in the end, that's what we're all going to be defined by. That's what our program is going to be defined by; not by these trophies. Our program is going to be defined by the type of men that leave our program. And what they do when they get out in the society, the type of future presidents they become, and governors, and CEOs, and coaches, and teachers, and NFL players -- whatever it is -- that's what our program is going to be defined by. We got a quote that we kind of live by. We started the season and kind of talked about this quote.**

*And I don't know who said it, but it says this. It says: What you can vividly imagine and ardently believe, and enthusiastically act upon, will inevitably come to be. This team dreamed big, they believed big. And last Monday, you saw them enthusiastically act upon that dream and belief. But my favorite part of this team, and what I'll always remember, is that they truly enjoyed the journey.**

*I can’t tell you how many times we kind of hit pause. A lot of times, with young people, everybody wants to hit fast-forward. But this team, we hit pause a lot, and really, truly enjoyed the journey. And it really made it so much spec- -- more special for me. And in the end, that's what it should be about: just finding joy in the journey of whatever it is that we're doing.**

*So I want to close, and I really want to give this perspective to our team and, really, to anybody who's listening. This is a quote. And the whole college football world was captured by Tyler Trent. He was the Purdue football fan that was battling cancer. You probably saw that he just passed, just recently.**

*And here's what he said. He put out a quote, and he said: "Though I am in hospice care and have to wake up every morning knowing that the day might be my last, I still have a choice to make: to make that day the best it can be. Yet, isn’t that a choice we all have every day? After all, nobody knows the amount of days that we have left.**

*Some could say we are all in hospice, to a certain degree. So why don't we act like it? Where is your gratitude? With Christmas coming up, what are you thankful for? I had to write my will recently, and I'm just grateful that I can give my family Christmas presents, maybe even for [The] last time. Let's not forget that my doctors gave me three months to live almost two and a half months ago.**

*So why can't we live grateful lives? Why can't we make every day count like it's the last?" So for this team, and all you guys moving on, and even the guys coming back, that's what I would say, is go live and be great today. In order for your Sunday to become a reality, you just got to be your best today and truly enjoy the journey, because I always believe the best is yet to come.**

*So, President Trump, I can't thank you enough for this very special opportunity, and all the dignitaries here, to honor our football team on something that we earned and something that happened all the way on the other coast, in California, one week ago. What a special moment we will remember for the rest of our lives.**

*But it pales in comparison to the relationships and the journey that it took to get there. But on behalf of our team, our staff, the Board of Trustees, our president, and our AD, I want to thank you so much for this opportunity that you gave us. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Thank you, Coach, for those kind words. Thank you, Mr. President, for your kind and inspirational words. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here. Good evening. Go Tigers! I'm only stepping up because the President asked me to come on up. So I'm going to go ahead and add to my thanks. Mr. President, it is great to be back at the White House, for the second time in the past 19 months, with our football team to celebrate our national championship.**

*Mr. President, I appreciate very much your kindness and your hospitality, and the fine dinner that you served us, and for inviting us to be with you today. It is an honor and a privilege to be standing here in the White House as we celebrate the accomplishments of this amazing group of men who represent Clemson so well, on and off the field.**

*I do want to thank, if I can, Mr. President, our Board of Trustees for their outstanding leadership. We're blessed at Clemson to have an incredible Board who cares deeply about Clemson academics and athletics. So I do want to thank the entire South Carolina congressional delegation for their strong support of our great university.**

*And I know, Mr. President, you pointed them out, but in particular I do want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott for being here this evening and for always supporting us. I also want to thank Congressman Jeff Duncan, a proud Clemson alumnus and former Clemson football player who does an outstanding job in our home district.**

*Would you please help me thank them for all they do for the university? [Applause] And, Mr. President, I do also want to thank our Governor, Henry McMaster, for his leadership of our great state. The Governor was not able to join us tonight due to a scheduling conflict, but he did want me to pass on to you his warm regards.**

*Tonight, we honor these young men and these coaches who are a wonderful example of the high standards we set in everything that we do at Clemson, from athletics to academics. These student athletes, as you know, worked incredibly hard to accomplish their dream of being the number-one college football team and the only one in the modern era to go a perfect 15 and 0. And I want you to know, gentlemen, you made the Clemson family proud along that journey.**

*And, Mr. President, our players succeed in the classroom, as well. We had 26 players on this team who earned their degree. That was more than any other team to play in a bowl game. And this championships, as I said, on Saturday was truly a team victory -- from our student athletes who worked so hard on the field and in practice, to our coaches, to our recruiting staff, to the social media team, to our faculty, to the academic advisors in the Nieri Center, to the medical staff and trainers, to the facilities team, to the support staff, to our donors, and all of those who worked in any way, shape, or form for this program.**

*All of them played an important role in making this happen. And, of course, I'm very thankful that this team is led by Coach Dabo Swinney, a man of great integrity and of the highest character, who is on a serious mission that goes beyond football. And he cares so very deeply about developing his players into young men who will be successful in life.**

*And I do want to acknowledge and thank our outstanding Athletic Director, Dan Radakovich. His leadership has taken Clemson athletics to the highest level possible. Coach Swinney has a motto that all of you know, and many of us at the university have adopted that, and this is: Best is the standard. At Clemson, we strive every day to live up to that standard across the entire university.**

*The success of our football team and athletics, in general, has helped to elevate the entire profile of our great university. We're at an all-time high in almost every possible measure, from academic rankings, to applications, to retention rates, graduation rates, fundraising, research funding, ACT scores, SAT scores, and so many other measures.**

*We are determined -- all of us in this room and back at the university -- to keep pushing every single day to make a difference and to take Clemson to greater heights and service to our students, to our home state of South Carolina, and to this great country. Thank you again, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.**

*Thank you for inviting us. Thank you for recognizing the Clemson University National Championship team. May God bless you all. And go Tigers. [Applause]**

*And as your president said, that president, he has done some job. We can never forget the great job he's done as a school, as a university. That's a fantastic -- a fantastic place, with an unbelievable reputation on its own. I think we're going to take the entire football team down to another special place, the Oval Office.**

*And I remember two years ago -- [Applause] -- two years ago, Coach, we did that. And a lot of other Presidents don’t do that. And we did it, and it seemed to have worked, right? [Laughter] Whatever it was. Because they all wanted to come back. So we're going to go; we're going to take the team down. I thought before I did that, I'd ask Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott -- two people that have represented your state very, very well and that love your team, and very special friends of mine.**

*So maybe I'll start off with Tim and Lindsey, and say a couple of words. And we're going to travel down to a very, very important location, the Oval Office. Okay? We'll do that. We'll take pictures. Good? He likes that. Good. [Applause] Please, Tim. Please.**

*Well, God bless you. How many of you guys are incredibly excited to be at the White House? [Applause] [Laughs] How many are looking forward to going down to the Oval Office? [Applause] How about we all -- how about we all give President Trump an amazing round of applause for being here tonight? [Applause] My comments will be quick.**

*South Carolina is so proud of Clemson University, and specifically the athletes who represent us so well off the field as much as you do on the field. I can't say it any better than Dabo said it himself a few weeks ago; maybe it was championship night. He said, if you put God first, others second, and then yourself, amazing things can happen. This is a fulfillment of that mission. [Applause]**

*Well, they said be short. I started this speech short and I'll end it short. [Laughter] You can tell this is an educated crowd. So I grew up in Central South Carolina. Anybody know where that's at? [Applause] Yeah. So when the Tigers played, it was good. My dad owned the liquor store, so every Saturday was good for business.**

*I went to Pelham, Alabama on vacation, Dabo. [Laughter] So, Tim has an incredible story. Mr. President, you have an incredible story. But these young men here, you have a story that nobody else can tell. Go Tigers. [Applause]**

*Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you, Tim. So, Coach, let's go on down to the Oval. And if the team would just follow -- I'm going to say, follow your coach. Well, follow your coach. But let's go to the Oval. Let's take some really great pictures that you're going to have for a long time. A long time. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. A tremendous honor. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]**

*Reason we did this is because of the shutdown. We want to make sure that everything is right. So we sent out, we got this, and we have some wonderful people working at the White House, they helped us out with this.**

*And I will say the Republicans are really, really sticking together. It's great to see, because we need border security. We have to have it. We have to have it. No doubt about it.

*It's great American food. And it'll be very interesting to see at the end of this evening how many are left.**

*Do you prefer McDonald's or Wendy's?**

*I like them all.**

*That's a tough question.**

*Not a softball.**

*If it's American, I like it. It's all-American stuff. So -- but it's good stuff. And we have the national champion team , as you know Clemson Tigers. And they a fantastic game against Alabama, and they're all here, they're right outside the room, and I think we're going to let you see them.**

*But I'll bet you as much food as we have, we have pizzas, we have 300 hamburgers, many, many french fries, all of our favorite foods. I want to see what's here when we leave, because I don't think it's going to be much.**

*Reason we did this is because of the shutdown. We want to make sure that everything is right. So we sent out, we got this, and we have some wonderful people working at the White House, they helped us out with this.**

*And I will say the Republicans are really, really sticking together. It's great to see, because we need border security. We have to have it. We have to have it. No doubt about it. Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it's gonna happen now. It's gonna happen now. Thank you very much everybody.**

*Thanks guys. [Crosstalk]**

*Enjoy your food. Good stuff. Grab one. Grab one, fellas. Grab one.**

*And joining me now by phone, the president of the United States, Donald Trump. Good evening, Mr. President.**

*Hi, Jeanine.**

*Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Is there an emergency at the southern border? Should we not now use the emergency funds and the powers that you have in your possession?**

*So, we have a humanitarian crisis, to put it mildly. People are trying to get in by the tens of thousands. They're rushing the border, there's right now in Honduras -- a country we pay a lot of money to, I think foolishly because they don't help us. But right now, you have another caravan forming, and it's going to be the biggest one yet.**

*We stopped the last one. You see what's going on in Tijuana. They couldn't get through because we have a wall there. We got a wall up. The military's been fantastic, Border Patrol has been incredible and ICE is, you know, these are brave people that do a great job. And we stopped them. But there's another big one forming.**

*We need a wall, very simple. Whether you call it a steel barrier, wall, it doesn't matter, but we need a very strong structure.**

*But by waiting to build the wall using those funds that are available to you in a national emergency, aren't you negating the point of the emergency itself?**

*Well, I have the absolute right to call a national emergency. Other presidents have called many national emergencies for things of lesser importance, frankly, than this. And I have the right to do it. I'd rather see the Democrats come back from their vacation and act. They're not acting, and they're the ones that are holding it up. It would take me 15 minutes to get a deal done, and everybody could go back to work.**

*But I'd like to see them act responsibly, and they're not acting responsibly, and that's it. We could be -- I’m in the White House, and most of them are in different locations. They're watching a certain musical in a very nice location and --**

*Of course, in Puerto Rico watching "Hamilton."**

*-- frankly, it’s ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous. We have a very important thing to do. We have to have border security, and we have to get people getting paid again very quickly.**

*But what about, as this happens, hook, you were in the White House -- look, you were in the White House during the Christmas holidays and over New Year's, and you've been there ever since. Nancy Pelosi's in Hawaii over the holidays, now she's in Puerto Rico with a bunch of Democrats and lobbyists, you know, enjoying the sun and partying down there.**

*But what makes you think that these people are willing to cut a deal? If you have shown your ability to negotiate by changing to a slat, agreeing to all of their demands as it relates to, you know, technology, electronic fencing and all of the other things, the humanitarian aid, they sit there, they don't even look you in the eye.**

*What makes you think that they're going to in any way cave? Because if these people said 13 and then, again, six years ago, we need a wall, we need a wall, but now, you're the president, they don't want a wall. What makes you think they're coming back?**

*Well, they might not. I mean, you know, frankly, I was willing to do something and we're asking for $5.6 billion, which is way less than what other presidents have been talking about. You know, if you look back, this should have been done 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. This should have been done by others.**

*Just like if you look at Jerusalem, if you look at the embassy moving to Jerusalem, every president promised that, they never did it. I did it. If you look at so many other things that I’ve done -- we're going well with a lot of -- you know, we're doing well with China. We’re doing well with North Korea.**

*We’re doing -- you know, I was left a very tough hand. But this was one of the problems, it’s our southern border. And it's, you know, thousands and thousands of people are coming in, and we have human smugglers, we have traffickers, we have people -- the biggest drug dealers in the world. And they're pouring through the parts of the border -- they don't go through your areas that are port of entry, Jeanine.**

*Ports of entry.**

*They go through areas where you don't have any protection whatsoever. And it's really very sad and very, very dangerous and very bad for our country. A lot of crime comes from that location.**

*You know, I interviewed Ron Vitiello, the acting director of ICE, and he said that there was enough fentanyl seized by them last year that could kill every American in this country. We know that 90 percent of the heroin comes through the southern border, and, you know, what we also know is that, or you know, there are 800,000 federal employees who didn't get a check yesterday.**

*You're sitting there waiting for a deal. The Democrats are not sitting with you. If this isn't an emergency, I don't know what is.**

*Well, I haven't actually left the White House in months. And in all fairness, I’m doing a lot of other work. It’s not just that, but that's a very important element of what I’m doing, because we have to get the southern border done. And I’ve been here virtually every night, I guess every night other than one day I flew to Iraq and then to Germany to see our troops.**

*Yes.**

*And it was great. To see them, was great. The level of love they have for this country is incredible. So I flew and then came back. I’m not even sure I actually missed a night, per se. But basically, I’ve been here for many months in the White House. And I -- you know, I’m a worker.**

*I know you --**

*I’m like you, I’m a worker.**

*You are a worker.**

*And, frankly, I’m ready, willing and able to get a deal done. But they don’t -- they think it's politics. I think it's bad politics. This country wants to have protection at the border. Many of our crimes, much -- MS-13 comes through the border, drugs, a big proportion of the drugs from, you know, that we have from this country -- in this country come through the border.**

*The human trafficking where they tie women up, they put duct tape over their mouth --**

*Right.**

*-- electrical tape, and they bring them and they traffic in women and children, and they come through the border, the areas that I’m talking about putting a wall. We do that, it can't happen anymore. It's unbelievable. It's only politics. That's the game they're playing. I actually think it's bad politics for them.**

*So then, you know, when Nancy Pelosi won, you very warmly in November congratulated her, and are you still confident you can get a deal done with her, or has that ship sailed?**

*No idea. No idea. Well, we won also. You know, we won the Senate.**

*Right, right.**

*And, you know, there are those that would say that the Senate is more important. And, for the most part, I campaigned for the Senate.**

*Yes.**

*And we got very little credit. Like even you -- you just said they won, we won the Senate. We actually picked up additional seats.**

*You did, yes.**

*We beat incumbents, Democrat, and almost everywhere I went, we won. But, you know, I’m one person, and the House had many races, and yet we won some great races where I went. But we won the Senate, Jeanine, we picked up two additional seats. It’s 53-47.**

*Right.**

*It was 51-49.**

*All right. So for the last time, given that they don't want to seem to come to the table, that you have done all the negotiating, why not declare? There’s --**

*Well, that might happen. But I want to give them a chance to see if they can act responsibly.**

*OK.**

*They should act responsibly. We're talking about the border, and I have to say a lot of the people that aren't getting their checks are letting us know we don't care, you've got to solve the crisis at the border. It's humanitarian crisis, and it's national security. It's very important.**

*OK. And it's interesting, that's what I heard yesterday from some of the border patrol agents. Now, I want to move on to another subject. "The New York Times" reported that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation the day after you fired James Comey in May of '17. And the investigation was whether you were actively working for Russia or unwittingly.**

*So, I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?**

*I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing. But the headline of that article, it's called "The failing New York Times" for a reason, they've gotten me wrong for three years.**

*They've actually gotten me wrong for many years before that. But you rook at what's going on, you know, I fired James Comey. I call him Lying James Comey because he was a terrible liar, and he did a terrible job as the FBI director. Look at what happened with the Hillary Clinton and the e-mails and the Hillary Clinton investigation, one of the biggest screw-ups that anybody's ever seen as an investigation.**

*And what happened after I fired him? Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, his lover, Lisa Page, they did it. And, you know, they're all gone. Most of those people, many, many people from the top ranks of the FBI, they've all been fired or they had to leave are. And they're all gone. This is what they were talking about.**

*And, obviously, nothing was found. And I can tell you this, if you ask the folks in Russia, I’ve been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other -- probably any other president period, but certainly the last three or four presidents, modern day presidents. Nobody's been as tough as I have from any standpoint, including the fact that we've done oil like we've never done it, we're setting records in country with oil and exporting oil and many other things.**

*So, which is, obviously, not great for them, because that's what they -- that's where they get their money for the most part. But many other things. So I think it was a great insult. And "The New York Times" is a disaster as a paper. It's a very horrible thing they said, and they've gone so far that people that weren't necessarily believers are now big believers, because they said that was a step too far.**

*They really are a disaster of a newspaper.**

*Well, you know, when you think about it, the people that were involved in that, all of the people have since been fired or gone, whether --**

*Right.**

*-- it's Strzok, page, McCabe. And also the Steele dossier. But "The Washington Times" -- "The Washington Post," I should say, is following up reporting that you went to unusual lengths to keep your conversations with President Putin under wraps. Why not release the conversation that you had with President Putin in Helsinki, along with some other stuff that might involve FISA, Bruce Ohr and the whole lot of them?**

*Well, Jeanine, I would, I don't with care. I mean, I had a conversation like every president does. You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. We had a great conversation. We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things. And it was a great conversation.**

*I’m not keeping anything under wraps, I couldn't care less. I mean, it's so ridiculous. These people make it up. "Washington Post", that's basically the lobbyist for Amazon. You know, he uses that -- Bezos has got bigger problems than anybody right now. But Bezos uses that as his lobbyist, OK, as far as I’m concerned.**

*And "The Washington Post" is almost as bad or probably as bad as "The New York Times." Think of it, I have a one-on-one meeting with Putin like I do with every other leader. I have many one-on-one -- nobody ever says anything about it. But with Putin they say, oh, what did they talk about? We talked about very positive things because -- look, we are beating everybody.**

*Our economy is the strongest in the world right now, Jeanine. Nobody even close. China's down 38 president. Russia's not doing well, its economy. Most countries are not doing well. We're doing phenomenally. Even though we're paying interest rates because we're normalizing. You know, Obama had zero interest.**

*Anybody can do that. And our economy's now better than ever. We're almost at our high with the stock market again. So, it's really -- can you imagine where they say that I met with Putin, I met with every leader just about individually. I meet with Modi, I meet with -- in Japan, I meet with Abe. I meet with all of them, but nobody says anything.**

*But I meet with Putin, and they make a big deal. Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs. You know, the whole Russia thing, it's a hoax. It's a terrible hoax. You know it probably better than -- you, Gregg Jarrett, so -- Dan Bongino. People that look at it, it’s a total hoax.**

*Everybody knows it. And it's really a shame because it takes time, and it takes effort. And everybody knows there was no collusion whatsoever. They have found no collusion, and they won't find collusion because I had nothing to do -- I was a better candidate than Hillary Clinton. She was a terrible candidate.**

*And the fact is, I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily -- 306-223, I believe. And that's a big difference in the college, in the Electoral College. [Crosstalk]**

*So that's -- but it's really, it's really a shame, Jeanine. It really is a shame. Such a waste of time.**

*It is a shame. It is a waste of time, it's a waste of energy, and, you know, some people have to say to themselves, how can you deal with all of this? This "New York Times" article, to be absolutely truthful with you, just seems to be another rehash of the same players and the same arguments, and the same dossier, you know, just to keep it going, and they'll keep it going as long as they can.**

*What keeps you going? I mean, you've got such fight in you, it is unbelievable.**

*Well, I guess I have good genes -- [Laughter]]**

*-- because, you know, somebody said the other day no president should have to go --**

*That's right.**

*-- through what you're going through, Mr. President. Because I’m going through all of this nonsense, it's all nonsense, but I have to be careful because these are dirty players. They're no good. And you've got the Mueller investigation, you've got all this nonsense. There's no collusion, no nothing. And, you know, they say this should never happen again.**

*Never again should this happen. And that's the story. But despite that, we've done more than any other administration by far in the first two years. We've had tremendous success.**

*All right. And now, of course, Little Adam Schiff, as you call him, is going to be dragging in, and Jerry Nadler are going to be bringing in Michael Cohen, an already-proven liar, to Congress, convicted of it. You know, are you -- are you worried that --**

*No, look, I was a client of his. You know, and you're supposed to have lawyer/client privilege, but it doesn't matter because if I’m a very honest person, frankly. But he's on trouble on some loans and fraud and taxi cabs and stuff that I know nothing about.**

*And taxi medallions.**

*And in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I’ll tell -- I’ll give you some information on the president. Well, there is no information. But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at. Because where does that money -- that's the money in the family.**

*And I guess he didn't want to talk about his father -- he's trying to get his sentence reduced. So, it's pretty sad. You know, it's weak and it's very sad to watch a thing like that. I couldn't care less.**

*What is his father-in-law's name?**

*I don't know, but you'll fine out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there. Again, I was a client. I was a client. He has a law firm. They broke into his law firm sometime early in the morning, I guess, and they took -- this couldn't happen to anybody except you're dealing with McCabe, you're dealing with the remnants of Comey.**

*And wait until you see how it all ends up, you watch. McCabe, Lisa Page, Strzok, wait until you see how that all ends up, including some others that I could name, but I -- [Crosstalk]**

*Will you release --**

*We’ll make -- we’ll make front page news if I do.**

*I can’t wait to read it. Will you release the FISA? We're all waiting for the FISA. That will give us -- [Crosstalk]**

*Well, at the right time, we will probably do that. If that's necessary, we'll do that. You know, that's very, very important stuff.**

*I know.**

*And, you know, as you know, a lot of bad things happened when a lot of elements of what we're talking about. And at the right time, we will probably do that. That's right.**

*All right. And my -- are your lawyers working to keep the Mueller report from being made public?**

*Well, I can't tell you because I don't devote too much time -- here's the bottom line, there was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no anything. So, you know, no calls to Russia. No nothing. So, you know, it's all nonsense, Jeanine. It’s all -- it's a hoax. It's called the Russian hoax or witch, you know, it's a witch hunt.**

*And it's a shame. And, you know, despite that what we're doing is amazing. But actually, what we're doing in this, too, because we're exposing people that are corrupt. People are being exposed by this that are totally corrupt. A lot of the people that don't get mentioned even in that article today, the phony article in "The New York Times", there's a lot of corruption, and we're exposing it. And I’m going to put that down someday as one of my greatest achievements.**

*Well, I look forward to hearing that that. And I guess one last question, Mr. President, when are you going to get out of the White House? I mean, Washington after a while gets very depressing.**

*Well, I love it, and I love this building, and I do a lot of work in the building. And if you looked at what we're doing on the deal with China which nobody was able to take on, and we're taking it on great, we're doing an incredible deal for our country. You look at Iran. When I ended the Iran nuclear deal, look what happened to Iran.**

*It's a different country than it was when I came here two years ago.**

*Right.**

*And all of the trade deals we're making with Mexico -- and, by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall because the trade deal --**

*Right.**

*-- is billions and billions of dollars better than the old NAFTA deal. And I call that -- Mexico is absolutely paying for the wall. So, I mean, we're doing a great job, and I like doing it. And then we get involved with the Russian hoax or, you know, whatever you call it.**

*Or distraction.**

*It’s -- you know, it's one of those things, but I love doing it, the whole thing. But this will turn out to be very important because people are going to be exposed that nobody ever thought possible.**

*Well, I look forward to that. And I have to ask you another post, last question. You're hearing about all these people looking to run against you in 2020. Your thoughts?**

*I’m not worried. So far, I love the competition. I love what I see.**

*All right.**

*I love what I see. You know, a couple of them aren't running that I was hoping were going to run, they just announced yesterday that they weren't looking. I was sort of looking forward to that. But you're going to have probably 30 people, close to 30 people, maybe more. I heard as many as 32. And I see nobody, in fact, I guess Bruce Springsteen, Moore, all these guys are saying we're not going to beat him again.**

*We're not going to -- so they're all going around saying, and they’re not -- look, we're doing too well. If anybody beat me, we have the greatest unemployment and employment numbers that we've ever had as a country.**

*That's right. That’s right. Who -- [Crosstalk]**

*African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, the overall number, historically the best numbers we've ever had. The economy is the best economy we've ever had. More people are working today, Jeanine, in our country than have ever worked in our country before. I don't know, how does somebody beat that?**

*We have great trade deals. I cut taxes down to the lowest number that they've been in many years, bigger than the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. We have ANWR.**

*Right.**

*We got rid of the individual mandate on this horrible Obamacare, which we'll end up taking care of. Watch what's going to happen there. So, you know, we're doing a good job, and I think people see it.**

*Who is the one person that you would really like to run against?**

*Well, I don't want to pick anyone out. You know, a lot of people say Biden's doing OK, but he was always a one percenter. He was a 1 percent guy. He ran two or three times, he never got above 1 percent. And then Obama came along and took him off the trash heap, and he became a vice president, and now he's probably leading.**

*But he's basically a 1 percent guy. He's weak.**

*Yes.**

*So we'll see what happens with him. But I think he's leading right now, from what I understand.**

*Really?**

*But I’ll be watching. Whoever it is, I think we're going to do just fine.**

*Mr. President, I really hope you get out of the White House, I really do. I think you deserve a vacation.**

*Well, I like the symbol -- I’ll be honest, I like the symbol of being here. You know, to be totally honest with you -- I mean, your audience know I’m a straight shooter. I like the symbol of me being here and them being at some play in a nice location having a good time. I like that symbol because I am ready to sign.**

*And they're not. And they're not.**

*All right.**

*So we'll see what happens. And if they don't do it, if they don't come to their senses, you know what I’ll do? I'll do a national emergency. We're all set. It's 100 percent.**

*Yes.**

*And I’ll have to do that. But, honestly, we shouldn't have to. But you know what, Jeanine? They're going to want something from me someday, very important, because I have to sign everything. Everything has to go through the White House. Mitch McConnell and the Republicans have done an incredible job, and they have stuck together like glue.**

*We have tremendous support.**

*Good.**

*But, you know, they're going to want something from us for one of their favorite little deals. And all of a sudden, they're going to find out it's going to be very, very tough for them. We need security at the southern border for our country.**

*All right. Well, I’ll tell you, Mr. President, when you reference the viewers, the "Justice" viewers, they are behind you 100 percent.**

*Thank you very much, Jeanine. That's nice.**

*Mr. President, thank you for being with us tonight. We -- we're very grateful.**

*Thank you, Jeanine. Thank you very much.**

*And joining me now by phone, the president of the United States, Donald Trump. Good evening, Mr. President.**

*Hi, Jeanine.**

*Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Is there an emergency at the southern border? Should we not now use the emergency funds and the powers that you have in your possession?**

*So, we have a humanitarian crisis, to put it mildly. People are trying to get in by the tens of thousands. They're rushing the border, there's right now in Honduras -- a country we pay a lot of money to, I think foolishly because they don't help us.

*But what makes you think that these people are willing to cut a deal? If you have shown your ability to negotiate by changing to a slat, agreeing to all of their demands as it relates to, you know, technology, electronic fencing and all of the other things, the humanitarian aid, they sit there, they don't even look you in the eye.**

*What makes you think that they're going to in any way cave? Because if these people said 13 and then, again, six years ago, we need a wall, we need a wall, but now, you're the president, they don't want a wall. What makes you think they're coming back?**

*I know you --**

*I’m like you, I’m a worker.**

*You are a worker.**

*And, frankly, I’m ready, willing and able to get a deal done. But they don’t -- they think it's politics. I think it's bad politics. This country wants to have protection at the border. Many of our crimes, much -- MS-13 comes through the border, drugs, a big proportion of the drugs from, you know, that we have from this country -- in this country come through the border.**

*The human trafficking where they tie women up, they put duct tape over their mouth --**

*Right.**

*-- electrical tape, and they bring them and they traffic in women and children, and they come through the border, the areas that I’m talking about putting a wall. We do that, it can't happen anymore. It's unbelievable. It's only politics. That's the game they're playing. I actually think it's bad politics for them.**

*So then, you know, when Nancy Pelosi won, you very warmly in November congratulated her, and are you still confident you can get a deal done with her, or has that ship sailed?**

*No idea. No idea. Well, we won also. You know, we won the Senate.**

*Right, right.**

*And, you know, there are those that would say that the Senate is more important. And, for the most part, I campaigned for the Senate.**

*Yes.**

*And we got very little credit. Like even you -- you just said they won, we won the Senate. We actually picked up additional seats.**

*You did, yes.**

*We beat incumbents, Democrat, and almost everywhere I went, we won. But, you know, I’m one person, and the House had many races, and yet we won some great races where I went. But we won the Senate, Jeanine, we picked up two additional seats. It’s 53-47.**

*Right.**

*It was 51-49.**

*All right. So for the last time, given that they don't want to seem to come to the table, that you have done all the negotiating, why not declare? There’s --**

*Well, that might happen. But I want to give them a chance to see if they can act responsibly.**

*OK.**

*They should act responsibly. We're talking about the border, and I have to say a lot of the people that aren't getting their checks are letting us know we don't care, you've got to solve the crisis at the border. It's humanitarian crisis, and it's national security. It's very important.**

*OK. And it's interesting, that's what I heard yesterday from some of the border patrol agents. Now, I want to move on to another subject. "The New York Times" reported that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation the day after you fired James Comey in May of '17. And the investigation was whether you were actively working for Russia or unwittingly.**

*So, I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?**

*I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing. But the headline of that article, it's called "The failing New York Times" for a reason, they've gotten me wrong for three years.**

*They've actually gotten me wrong for many years before that. But you rook at what's going on, you know, I fired James Comey. I call him Lying James Comey because he was a terrible liar, and he did a terrible job as the FBI director. Look at what happened with the Hillary Clinton and the e-mails and the Hillary Clinton investigation, one of the biggest screw-ups that anybody's ever seen as an investigation.**

*And what happened after I fired him? Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, his lover, Lisa Page, they did it. And, you know, they're all gone. Most of those people, many, many people from the top ranks of the FBI, they've all been fired or they had to leave are. And they're all gone. This is what they were talking about.**

*And, obviously, nothing was found. And I can tell you this, if you ask the folks in Russia, I’ve been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other -- probably any other president period, but certainly the last three or four presidents, modern day presidents. Nobody's been as tough as I have from any standpoint, including the fact that we've done oil like we've never done it, we're setting records in country with oil and exporting oil and many other things.**

*So, which is, obviously, not great for them, because that's what they -- that's where they get their money for the most part. But many other things. So I think it was a great insult. And "The New York Times" is a disaster as a paper. It's a very horrible thing they said, and they've gone so far that people that weren't necessarily believers are now big believers, because they said that was a step too far.**

*They really are a disaster of a newspaper.**

*Well, you know, when you think about it, the people that were involved in that, all of the people have since been fired or gone, whether --**

*Right.**

*-- it's Strzok, page, McCabe. And also the Steele dossier. But "The Washington Times" -- "The Washington Post," I should say, is following up reporting that you went to unusual lengths to keep your conversations with President Putin under wraps. Why not release the conversation that you had with President Putin in Helsinki, along with some other stuff that might involve FISA, Bruce Ohr and the whole lot of them?**

*Well, Jeanine, I would, I don't with care. I mean, I had a conversation like every president does. You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. We had a great conversation. We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things. And it was a great conversation.**

*I’m not keeping anything under wraps, I couldn't care less. I mean, it's so ridiculous. These people make it up. "Washington Post", that's basically the lobbyist for Amazon. You know, he uses that -- Bezos has got bigger problems than anybody right now. But Bezos uses that as his lobbyist, OK, as far as I’m concerned.**

*And "The Washington Post" is almost as bad or probably as bad as "The New York Times." Think of it, I have a one-on-one meeting with Putin like I do with every other leader. I have many one-on-one -- nobody ever says anything about it. But with Putin they say, oh, what did they talk about? We talked about very positive things because -- look, we are beating everybody.**

*Our economy is the strongest in the world right now, Jeanine. Nobody even close. China's down 38 president. Russia's not doing well, its economy. Most countries are not doing well. We're doing phenomenally. Even though we're paying interest rates because we're normalizing. You know, Obama had zero interest.**

*Anybody can do that. And our economy's now better than ever. We're almost at our high with the stock market again. So, it's really -- can you imagine where they say that I met with Putin, I met with every leader just about individually. I meet with Modi, I meet with -- in Japan, I meet with Abe. I meet with all of them, but nobody says anything.**

*But I meet with Putin, and they make a big deal. Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs. You know, the whole Russia thing, it's a hoax. It's a terrible hoax. You know it probably better than -- you, Gregg Jarrett, so -- Dan Bongino. People that look at it, it’s a total hoax.**

*Everybody knows it. And it's really a shame because it takes time, and it takes effort. And everybody knows there was no collusion whatsoever. They have found no collusion, and they won't find collusion because I had nothing to do -- I was a better candidate than Hillary Clinton. She was a terrible candidate.**

*And the fact is, I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily -- 306-223, I believe. And that's a big difference in the college, in the Electoral College. [Crosstalk]**

*So that's -- but it's really, it's really a shame, Jeanine. It really is a shame. Such a waste of time.**

*It is a shame. It is a waste of time, it's a waste of energy, and, you know, some people have to say to themselves, how can you deal with all of this? This "New York Times" article, to be absolutely truthful with you, just seems to be another rehash of the same players and the same arguments, and the same dossier, you know, just to keep it going, and they'll keep it going as long as they can.**

*What keeps you going? I mean, you've got such fight in you, it is unbelievable.**

*Well, I guess I have good genes -- [Laughter]]**

*-- because, you know, somebody said the other day no president should have to go --**

*That's right.**

*-- through what you're going through, Mr. President. Because I’m going through all of this nonsense, it's all nonsense, but I have to be careful because these are dirty players. They're no good. And you've got the Mueller investigation, you've got all this nonsense. There's no collusion, no nothing. And, you know, they say this should never happen again.**

*Never again should this happen. And that's the story. But despite that, we've done more than any other administration by far in the first two years. We've had tremendous success.**

*All right. And now, of course, Little Adam Schiff, as you call him, is going to be dragging in, and Jerry Nadler are going to be bringing in Michael Cohen, an already-proven liar, to Congress, convicted of it. You know, are you -- are you worried that --**

*No, look, I was a client of his. You know, and you're supposed to have lawyer/client privilege, but it doesn't matter because if I’m a very honest person, frankly. But he's on trouble on some loans and fraud and taxi cabs and stuff that I know nothing about.**

*And taxi medallions.**

*And in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I’ll tell -- I’ll give you some information on the president. Well, there is no information. But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at. Because where does that money -- that's the money in the family.**

*And I guess he didn't want to talk about his father -- he's trying to get his sentence reduced. So, it's pretty sad. You know, it's weak and it's very sad to watch a thing like that. I couldn't care less.**

*What is his father-in-law's name?**

*I don't know, but you'll fine out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there. Again, I was a client. I was a client. He has a law firm. They broke into his law firm sometime early in the morning, I guess, and they took -- this couldn't happen to anybody except you're dealing with McCabe, you're dealing with the remnants of Comey.**

*And wait until you see how it all ends up, you watch. McCabe, Lisa Page, Strzok, wait until you see how that all ends up, including some others that I could name, but I -- [Crosstalk]**

*Will you release --**

*We’ll make -- we’ll make front page news if I do.**

*I can’t wait to read it. Will you release the FISA? We're all waiting for the FISA. That will give us -- [Crosstalk]**

*Well, at the right time, we will probably do that. If that's necessary, we'll do that. You know, that's very, very important stuff.**

*I know.**

*And, you know, as you know, a lot of bad things happened when a lot of elements of what we're talking about. And at the right time, we will probably do that. That's right.**

*All right. And my -- are your lawyers working to keep the Mueller report from being made public?**

*Well, I can't tell you because I don't devote too much time -- here's the bottom line, there was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no anything. So, you know, no calls to Russia. No nothing. So, you know, it's all nonsense, Jeanine. It’s all -- it's a hoax. It's called the Russian hoax or witch, you know, it's a witch hunt.**

*And it's a shame. And, you know, despite that what we're doing is amazing. But actually, what we're doing in this, too, because we're exposing people that are corrupt. People are being exposed by this that are totally corrupt. A lot of the people that don't get mentioned even in that article today, the phony article in "The New York Times", there's a lot of corruption, and we're exposing it. And I’m going to put that down someday as one of my greatest achievements.**

*Well, I look forward to hearing that that. And I guess one last question, Mr. President, when are you going to get out of the White House? I mean, Washington after a while gets very depressing.**

*Well, I love it, and I love this building, and I do a lot of work in the building. And if you looked at what we're doing on the deal with China which nobody was able to take on, and we're taking it on great, we're doing an incredible deal for our country. You look at Iran. When I ended the Iran nuclear deal, look what happened to Iran.**

*It's a different country than it was when I came here two years ago.**

*Right.**

*And all of the trade deals we're making with Mexico -- and, by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall because the trade deal --**

*Right.**

*-- is billions and billions of dollars better than the old NAFTA deal. And I call that -- Mexico is absolutely paying for the wall. So, I mean, we're doing a great job, and I like doing it. And then we get involved with the Russian hoax or, you know, whatever you call it.**

*Or distraction.**

*It’s -- you know, it's one of those things, but I love doing it, the whole thing. But this will turn out to be very important because people are going to be exposed that nobody ever thought possible.**

*Well, I look forward to that. And I have to ask you another post, last question. You're hearing about all these people looking to run against you in 2020. Your thoughts?**

*I’m not worried. So far, I love the competition. I love what I see.**

*All right.**

*I love what I see. You know, a couple of them aren't running that I was hoping were going to run, they just announced yesterday that they weren't looking. I was sort of looking forward to that. But you're going to have probably 30 people, close to 30 people, maybe more. I heard as many as 32. And I see nobody, in fact, I guess Bruce Springsteen, Moore, all these guys are saying we're not going to beat him again.**

*We're not going to -- so they're all going around saying, and they’re not -- look, we're doing too well. If anybody beat me, we have the greatest unemployment and employment numbers that we've ever had as a country.**

*That's right. That’s right. Who -- [Crosstalk]**

*African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, the overall number, historically the best numbers we've ever had. The economy is the best economy we've ever had. More people are working today, Jeanine, in our country than have ever worked in our country before. I don't know, how does somebody beat that?**

*We have great trade deals. I cut taxes down to the lowest number that they've been in many years, bigger than the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. We have ANWR.**

*Right.**

*We got rid of the individual mandate on this horrible Obamacare, which we'll end up taking care of. Watch what's going to happen there. So, you know, we're doing a good job, and I think people see it.**

*Who is the one person that you would really like to run against?**

*Well, I don't want to pick anyone out. You know, a lot of people say Biden's doing OK, but he was always a one percenter. He was a 1 percent guy. He ran two or three times, he never got above 1 percent. And then Obama came along and took him off the trash heap, and he became a vice president, and now he's probably leading.**

*But he's basically a 1 percent guy. He's weak.**

*Yes.**

*So we'll see what happens with him. But I think he's leading right now, from what I understand.**

*Really?**

*But I’ll be watching. Whoever it is, I think we're going to do just fine.**

*Mr. President, I really hope you get out of the White House, I really do. I think you deserve a vacation.**

*Well, I like the symbol -- I’ll be honest, I like the symbol of being here. You know, to be totally honest with you -- I mean, your audience know I’m a straight shooter. I like the symbol of me being here and them being at some play in a nice location having a good time. I like that symbol because I am ready to sign.**

*And they're not. And they're not.**

*All right.**

*So we'll see what happens. And if they don't do it, if they don't come to their senses, you know what I’ll do? I'll do a national emergency. We're all set. It's 100 percent.**

*Yes.**

*And I’ll have to do that. But, honestly, we shouldn't have to. But you know what, Jeanine? They're going to want something from me someday, very important, because I have to sign everything. Everything has to go through the White House. Mitch McConnell and the Republicans have done an incredible job, and they have stuck together like glue.**

*We have tremendous support.**

*Good.**

*But, you know, they're going to want something from us for one of their favorite little deals. And all of a sudden, they're going to find out it's going to be very, very tough for them. We need security at the southern border for our country.**

*All right. Well, I’ll tell you, Mr. President, when you reference the viewers, the "Justice" viewers, they are behind you 100 percent.**

*Thank you very much, Jeanine. That's nice.**

*Mr. President, thank you for being with us tonight. We -- we're very grateful.**

*Thank you, Jeanine. Thank you very much.**
